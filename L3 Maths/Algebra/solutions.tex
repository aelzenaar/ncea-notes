\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
What does it really mean to \emph{solve} an equation? These notes attempt
to briefly present an outline to Level 3 and Scholarship methods for both finding
solutions to equations and interpreting those solutions.

We will begin with simple linear equations, and will work our way up to arbitrary
polynomials. Geometric and algebraic interpretations will be presented, along with
a number of examples and exercises.

Philosophically, we have made the decision to leave a number of important results
(chiefly de~Moirve's theorem) as exercises. However, these results are required
knowledge for the later problems --- so the reader should at least glance at previous
problems before attempting later ones.

Some exercises are much more difficult than others, and the difficulty does not
always increase within a section (i.e. sometimes the first exercises can be quite
hard). The number of stars by each problem is roughly indicative of a mixture of
difficulty and time required. There is, however, no guarantee that the author's
idea of a difficult question will match up with the reader's idea of a difficult
question!

Note that there are fully worked answers for all problems, and often these solutions
contain insights or additional information not in the main text. They are designed to
be read in conjunction with the problems (but have a go yourself before reading the
solutions). Additional information on the problems themselves, as well as a discussion
of some notation, can be found in the introduction to the solutions.

The culmination of the text comes in sections \ref{sec:roots} and \ref{sec:cubic}; the former is a digression
into more pure mathematics (developing a theory of the roots of unity), and the latter
is a more applied section (developing the solution of the general cubic). Both should
be easily within reach of the enthusiastic student. The section on geometry, \ref{sec:geometry}, also includes
a selection of material beyond that needed for level 3.

\section{Quadratic Equations}\label{sec:quadratic}

Even earlier than the Greeks, mathematics was being done in ancient Babylon.
Several ancient clay tablets from the Old Babylonian period (between 1800 and 1600 BCE)
contain mathematical problems and solutions. Such a problem, given on the tablet
illustrated in \cref{fig:babylon2}, is (translated of course):\footnote{~Translation from \cite{Ste08}.}

\begin{quote}
  I have added up seven times the side of my square and eleven times the area,
  getting 6;15.
\end{quote}

\begin{figure}\label{fig:babylon2}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{babylon2}
  \caption[blag]{Tablet BM 13901; image from the British Museum.}
\end{figure}

The number 6;15 is in sexagesimal notation; it means $ 6 + \frac{15}{60} = 6.25 $. We
can therefore rewrite this problem as follows, where $ x $ is the length of the side
of the square and $ x^2 $ is the area:
\begin{displaymath}
  11x^2 + 7x = 6.25
\end{displaymath}
Rearranging this we have $ 11x^2 + 7x - 6.25 = 0 $, and so we see that our problem is simply
to find the $ y$-intercepts of a parabola, graphed as \cref{fig:parabola1}. We find that the
only positive solution to the equation is $ x = 0.5 $ --- or 0;30 in Babylonian notation.

      xlabel=$x$,

    ]
      \addplot[domain=-1:1, samples=100, color=purple]{11*x^2 + 7*x - 6.25};
    \end{axis}
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{The graph of $ y = 11x^2 + 7x - 6.25 $.\label{fig:parabola1}}
\end{figure}

This problem is an example of a quadratic equation --- an equation where the highest
power of $ x $ is 2. All quadratic equations can be put into the form $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $,
where $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $ are constants.

All of the equations which we will consider this year can be put into the form $ f(x) = 0 $ for
some function $ f $. The values $ x $ which satisfy the equation are called \emph{solutions} of
the equation, or \emph{roots} or \emph{zeroes} of the function.

\subsection*{The Quadratic Formula}
In fact, there is a general formula to solve \emph{any} quadratic equation. The
following proof of this illustrates the idea of \emph{completing the square}, which
is a way to reduce the difficult problem of solving a general quadratic equation to a simpler
problem: that of solving $ y^2 = m $ for $ y $ given a value for $ m $. A second
proof is given as an exercise at the end of the section.

\begin{thm}[Quadratic Formula]
  A quadratic equation $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $ (where $ a \neq 0 $) has at most
  two solutions, which are given by
  \begin{displaymath}
    x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
  \end{displaymath}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  We want to transform our equation so that it looks like $ (\cdots)^2 = d $; then we can just take the square root of both sides and
  solve. Let us na\"ively guess that the bracket will look like $ a(x + b/2a)^2 $. If we expand this, we have
  \begin{displaymath}
    a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = ax^2 + bx + \frac{b^2}{4a}.
  \end{displaymath}
  Comparing with our original equation, we are almost there: if we add on the constant term $ c - \frac{b^2}{4a} $, all the unwanted
  material vanishes and we are left with the correct expression. With a little bit of manipulation, we obtain the required explicit
  formula for the solutions:
  \begin{gather*}
    0 = ax^2 + bx + c = a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + c - \frac{b^2}{4a}\\
    \frac{b^2}{4a} + c = a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2\\
    \pm\sqrt{\frac{b^2}{4a^2} + \frac{c}{a}} - \frac{b}{2a} = x\\
    \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = x.
  \end{gather*}
\end{proof}

The expression $ b^2 - 4ac = \Delta_2 $ is known as the \textit{discriminant} of the
quadratic, and it determines the nature of the solutions; if $ \Delta_2 = 0 $, there is
one repeated root, while if $ \Delta_2 > 0 $ there are two real roots. We discuss the case
where $ \Delta_2 < 0 $ later on.

\subsection*{Factors}
To create a quadratic equation with given solutions, we write down a linear expression
for each solution that evaluates to zero when the solution is substituted in, and then multiply
them. For example, if we wanted a quadratic equation with the solutions $ x = 2 $ and $ x = 3 $,
we take the two expressions $ x - 2 $ and $ x - 3 $, multiply the left hand sides together
(obtaining $ (x-2)(x-3) = x^2 - 5x + 6 $), and set it to zero.

This works because if we substitute in one of our original solutions (in our
example, 2 or 3) then one of the two parts of the left hand side will become zero
and so the entire left hand side becomes zero.

In general, this idea works for higher-degree equations (like cubics, quartics,
and so on). We can make a cubic with the solutions $ x = -3 $, $ x = 9 $, and
$ x = 13 $ by writing $ 0 = (x+3)(x-9)(x-13) $.

We can even multiply together higher-degree polynomials to create a polynomial
that has the roots of all of them --- if (for example) we take the equation
$ (x^2 - 4)(x^2 - 9) = 0 $, it will have the four solutions $ x = \pm 2 $ and $ x = \pm 3 $.

The polynomials which multiply together together to form a larger polynomial are known
as \textit{factors} of the larger polynomial, and the process of splitting a polynomial
into factors is known as \textit{factorising}.

  \hard Flesh out the following alternative proof of the quadratic formula from \cite{Edw84}. Let

        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Then $ x = \frac{1}{2} \left( (\alpha + \beta) + (\alpha - \beta) \right)
                         = \frac{1}{2} \left( (\alpha + \beta) + \sqrt{(\alpha - \beta)^2} \right) $.
          \item Note that $ \sqrt{(\alpha - \beta)^2} $ has two values and show that taking the negative
                value still gives a root.
          \item But $ \alpha + \beta = -b $ and $ (\alpha - \beta)^2 = b^2 - 4c $.
          \item So $ x = \frac{1}{2} \left( -b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4c} \right) $, which is the quadratic formula.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Higher-degree Polynomials}\label{section:poly}
Before we go any further, we must define the notion of a polynomial. A formal definition
allows us to reason exactly about a mathematical object with more precision than our
intuition.

\begin{defn}[Polynomial]
  A \emph{polynomial} is an expression that only has constant terms and terms involving
  powers of some variable. All polynomials can be written in the form
  $ a_n x^n + \cdots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 $, where $ x $ is the variable and
  $ a_{n...0} $ are the coefficients (and $ a_n \neq 0 $).

  The value $ n $ is called the \emph{degree} of the polynomial --- i.e. the degree of a
  quadratic equation is 2. Given a polynomial $ p $, we can write its degree as $ \partial p $.
\end{defn}

\subsection*{Factorising and Division}
We can find solutions to general polynomial equations $ p(x) = 0 $ by factorising
them and then finding the zeros of each factor. This is the reverse of the process
outlined in the previous section for creating polynomials with an arbitrary number of solutions.

\begin{center}
\textbf{Solving a polynomial equation is equivalent to finding its factors.}
\end{center}

For example, if we take the equation $ x^2 + 3x + 2 $ then we can see that two factors of this are $ (x+1) $ and
$ (x+2) $ (because $ x^2 + 3x + 2 = (x+1)(x+2) $). The two solutions are therefore $ x = -1 $
and $ x = -2 $.

Formally, we say that a polynomial $ g(x) $ is a factor of a polynomial $ p(x) $ if there is some polynomial
$ q(x) $ (the quotient) such that $ p(x) = g(x) \cdot q(x) $. In this case, we say that $ p(x) $
divided by $ g(x) $ is $ q(x) $. Even if $ g(x) $ is not a factor of $ p(x) $, it is possible to
write that $ p(x) = g(x) \cdot q(x) + r(x) $ for some remainder polynomial $ r $ if the degree of
$ g(x) $ is less than or equal to the degree of $ p(x) $. This is similar to the division of
integers: $ 11 = 2 \times 5 + 1 $ where the factor is 2, the quotient is 5, and the remainder is 1.

Higher-degree polynomials are much harder to factorise and solve. However,
once we find one factor we can divide it out to obtain a simpler polynomial. For example,
take the cubic $ x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 2 = 0$. We can see that one solution is $ x = 1 $ (it
is usually a good idea to try simple solutions like 1 and 0 first), and therefore one
factor of the equation is $ (x-1) $. If we divide out the cubic by this factor, we obtain
that $ x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 2 = (x-1)(x^2+3x+2) $, and we can solve the quadratic easily! The
three solutions to this cubic are therefore $ x = 1 $, $ x = -1 $, and $ x = -2 $. Figure \ref{fig:factgraph}
shows both the cubic (in blue) and its factors (in purple) to illustrate this idea.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
      xlabel=$x$,
      ylabel={$y$},
      axis lines=middle,
      scale=.8
    ]
      \addplot[domain=-3:2, samples=100, color=CornflowerBlue]{ x^3 + 2*x^2 - x - 2};
      \addplot[domain=-3:2, samples=5, color=purple]{ x - 1 };
      \addplot[domain=-3:2, samples=5, color=purple]{ x + 1 };
      \addplot[domain=-3:2, samples=5, color=purple]{ x + 2 };
    \end{axis}
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{The solutions to an equation are exactly the solutions of its factors.\label{fig:factgraph}}
\end{figure}

If we know that the solutions to a polynomial are integers, we need only try the factors
of the constant term as this term is simply the product of the roots of the polynomial.

One algorithm to divide one polynomial by another is long division, such as the following
calculation which provides us with an example of the division of a polynomial by another that is not a factor.

\begin{center}
  \polylongdiv{x^4 + x - 3}{x^2 - 1}
\end{center}

Here, we have divided $ p(x) = x^4 + x - 3 $ by $ g(x) = x^2 - 1 $ to obtain the quotient $ q(x) = x^2 + 1 $
and the remainder $ r(x) = x - 2 $ --- i.e. we can write $ x^4 + x - 3 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) + x - 2 $.

\subsection*{The Remainder Theorem}
One important theorem that follows from the idea of polynomial division is the remainder theorem.

\begin{thm}[Remainder Theorem]
  If we can write $ p(x) = (x-a) q(x) + r $, then $ p(a) = r $.
\end{thm}

Here we are dividing a polynomial $ p(x) $ by some other
linear equation $ (x-a) $, to get a quotient $ q(x) $ and a remainder $ r $
(which is just a number, not a polynomial, in this case). It follows that the
remainder is just the value of $ p(x) $ evaluated at $ a $.

\begin{proof}
  If we substitute $ a $ into the statement above, it simplifies and we obtain that
  $ p(a) = (a - a)q(a) + r = 0\cdot q(a) + r = r $.
\end{proof}

An important consequence of this theorem is that if $ a $ is a solution to the
polynomial, then $ r = p(a) = 0 $ and so $ (x - a) $ is a factor. As we expect,
the solutions to an equation are the same as the solutions to the factors of the equation.

If we can divide out a polynomial multiple times by a factor, we call the
root(s) corresponding to that factor "repeated." The \textit{multiplicity}
of some root $ \alpha $ of $ p(x) = 0 $ is the number of times that the factor
$ (x - \alpha) $ appears in $ p(x) $: i.e. the highest number $ n $ such that the division
of $ p(x) $ by $ (x - \alpha)^n $ gives a remainder of zero. The multiplicity, in some
sense, quantifies the number of times that a root is repeated.

A second application of the remainder theorem is less obvious --- we can
use it to evaluate polynomials. For example, we can use the remainder theorem
to find $ f(4) $ if $ f(x) = 4x^{17} - 4x^{16} + 3x^4 - 6x + 12 $ by dividing $ f(x) $
by $ (x - 4) $ and taking the remainder.

\subsection*{Exercises}

  \item Show that $ x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 $ divided by $ x^3 + 7 $ gives
        a quotient of $ x^3 + x^2 + x - 6 $ and a remainder of $ -6x^2 - 6x - 41 $ by
        expanding and simplifying $ (x^3 + 7)(x^3 + x^2 + x - 6) + (-6x^2 - 6x - 41) $.

\section{Complex Numbers}\label{sec:complex1}
\begin{aquote}{Philip Davis and Reuben Hersh}
  [Mathematics consists of] true facts about imaginary objects.
\end{aquote}
Now that we have somewhat developed the theory of polynomial equations, a sensible question to ask ourselves is the following.
\begin{center}
  \emph{When do polynomial equations have solutions?}
\end{center}
The answer to this simple question is actually quite nuanced, and occupied mathematicians in Europe for centuries.

Consider, for example, the simple quadratic equation
\begin{displaymath}
  x^2 - 2 = 0.
\end{displaymath}
Notice that the coefficients of this equation are integers, but the solutions are not --- in fact, the solutions ($ \pm \sqrt{2} $)
are not even rational! Notice also that the number of solutions is 2, the same as the degree of the polynomial.

Let us take a look at another example,
\begin{displaymath}
  x^3 - x = 0.
\end{displaymath}
Again, the degree of this polynomial is three --- as is the number of solutions that we obtain from it.

These two examples, as well as our previous work, suggest that the number of solutions of a polynomial is the same as its degree. There
is one problem with this, illustrated by another simple equation:
\begin{displaymath}
  x^2 + 1 = 0.
\end{displaymath}

If we try to solve this equation, we end up with a seemingly nonsense result: that $ x = \pm \sqrt{-1} $. Since there is no real
number with a negative square, it seems like we need to throw out our pretty result. However, remember that we have already seen
an example of an equation where the solution is out of reach if we only look for solutions that are the `same kind' as the coefficients.

Just as we extend the natural numbers to the integers, the integers to the rationals, and the rationals to the reals, we can
extend our number system further so that the equation $ x^2 + 1 = 0 $ has a solution. We begin by defining $ i $ to be a square
root of $ -1 $ (and setting $ -i $ to be the other square root); then the set of all numbers of the form $ a + bi $ (for any real
numbers $ a $ and $ b $) is called the set of \emph{complex numbers}; this system of writing them is called \emph{rectangular form}.

The complex numbers are generally considered to have been first used in Girolamo Cardano's \emph{Ars Magna} in 1545, where he
introduces them only to dismiss them as `as subtle as they are useless'. Despite this, modern mathematics has fully accepted the
existence of complex numbers for two main reasons: firstly they do not introduce any contradictions into basic arithmetic or
any theory that we care about, and secondly they allow us to state the following historic theorem.

\begin{thm}[Fundamental Theorem of Algebra]
  Let $ p(x) $ be a polynomial with complex coefficients. Then, counting repeated roots, there are exactly $ \partial p $ complex roots of $ p(x) $.
\end{thm}

The proof of the Fundamental Theorem unfortunately requires concepts and techniques far beyond the scope of this book. All proofs (that I am aware of) require
the use of analysis (i.e. there is no pure-algebra proof).\footnote{~Stewart gives a proof in \cite{Ste15}, and Artin gives two(!) proofs in \cite{Art91} \S 9.9.}

The first rigorous proof of the theorem was published by French mathematician Jean-Robert Argand in 1814; the name is somewhat
incorrect in the modern era as the study of algebra is no longer purely devoted to the properties of the complex number field.
An analogue of the theorem in a more modern context is Kronecker's Theorem, which states that a polynomial with coefficients
in set of numbers in which we can add, subtract, multiply, and divide has at least one solution in a `bigger' set of numbers that
contains the original set.

Given a complex number $ z = a + bi $, we call $ a $ the \emph{real part} of $ z $ and $ b $ the \emph{imaginary part}
of $ z $ (writing $ \realp{z} $ and $ \imagp{z} $ respectively). The term `imaginary' is purely historical --- the complex numbers
exist in exactly the same way that a number like $ \pi = 3.14159... $ or $ e = 2.718... $ exists.

We say that two complex numbers are equal \textbf{if and only if both the real and imaginary parts of those numbers are equal}, and
we perform arithmetic on complex numbers in the same way that we perform arithmetic on the reals, remembering that $ i^2 = -1 $.

Complex numbers also have a geometric interpretation. If we set up a mapping $ a + bi \mapsto (a, b) $ it is easy to see that we
have an exact correspondence between complex numbers and points on a Cartesian plane. This kind of diagram is called an \emph{Argand
diagram}, named after French mathematician Jean-Robert Argand.

For convenience, we also often associate with each complex number the unique \emph{vector} pointing from the origin to the location
of the point on the Argand plane. Given a complex number $ z = a + bi $, the length of its associated vector is called its \emph{modulus};
this is written $ \abs{z} $, and (by the Pythagorean theorem) we have the simple result that $ \abs{z} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $. The meaning
of this is exactly the same as that of the absolute value of a real number (and in fact the modulus of a real number is exactly its absolute
value) --- despite this, note that while there is a natural ordering on the real numbers (for example, $ -2 < 0 < \pi < \sqrt{17} $) there
can be no such ordering on the complex numbers. It is completely nonsensical to talk about any complex number being `bigger' than any other.

The five points marked on the Argand diagram in \cref{fig:argand} are $ i $, 1, $ 3+2i $, $ -1 - i $, and $ 2i - 1 $. See if you
can label each point on the diagram itself.

\subsection*{Addition and Subtraction}
Due to the way we constructed the complex numbers, there are natural rules for arithmetic. Suppose we have two complex numbers, $ u = a + bi $
and $ v = c + di $. We have the following rules for addition and subtraction by collecting the real and imaginary terms together:
\begin{align*}
  u + v &= (a + c) + (b + d)i, \text{ and} \\
  u - v &= (a - c) + (b - d)i.
\end{align*}

Geometrically, we are simply taking the vectors associated with each point and adding them.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
      xmin = 0, xmax = 5,
      ymin = 0, ymax = 6,
      xlabel=$\realp{z}$,
      ylabel={$\imagp{z}$},
      axis lines=middle,
      scale=.8
    ]
      \coordinate (O) at (0,0);
      \coordinate (A) at (3,2);
      \coordinate (B) at (1,3);
      \coordinate (S) at (4,5);
      \draw[very thick, BurntOrange, ->] (O)--(A);
      \draw[very thick, dotted, Mulberry, ->] (A)--(S);
      \draw[very thick, dotted, BurntOrange, ->] (B)--(S);
      \draw[very thick, Mulberry, ->] (O)--(B);
    \end{axis}
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{The addition of complex numbers.}
\end{figure}

Before we discuss multiplication of complex numbers, we will discuss one more simple but important operation: that of complex conjugation. Our intent
is to take the geometric property of reflection (across the real axis), and give it an algebraic meaning; in particular, the \emph{complex conjugate}
of $ z = a + bi $ is $ \overline z = a-bi $. An initial application of this concept is the simple result that if a polynomial has real coefficents,
any complex roots must come in conjugate pairs (you are asked to prove this in the special case of quadratic polynomials as exercise \ref{ex:conjquadratic},
and in the general case as exercise \ref{sec:finalexs}.\ref{ex:solutiongenerator}).

\subsection*{Multiplication}
There is a rule for multiplying complex numbers that is similar to the rules for addition; we simply collect like
terms and remember that $ i^2 = -1 $ in order to obtain the result
\begin{displaymath}
  (a+bi)(c+di) = ac + adi + bci + bdi^2 = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i.
\end{displaymath}

This way of writing the result is a little esoteric and has no nice geometric meaning. In order to remedy this problem, we rewrite our
complex numbers in \emph{polar form}. Instead of writing the number in the form $ z = a + bi $, where $ a $ and $ b $
are the distances from the two axes, we write $ z = r \cis \theta $, where $ r $ is the distance of the number from the
origin (simply the modulus $ \abs{z} $ again) and $ \theta $ is the angle that number's vector makes with the $ x$-axis
(known as the \emph{argument} of $ z $, and written as $ \carg(z) $). The function $ \cis \theta $ is defined to be $ \cos \theta + i\sin \theta $.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
      xmin = 0, xmax = 4,
      ymin = 0, ymax = 3,
      xticklabels = {,,},
      yticklabels = {,,},
      ticks=none,
      xlabel=$\realp{z}$,
      ylabel={$\imagp{z}$},
      axis lines=middle
    ]
      \coordinate (O) at (0,0);
      \node[circle, fill=ForestGreen, inner sep=0pt, minimum size=5pt, label=above right:{$ z = a + bi $}] (A) at (3,2) {};
      \coordinate (B) at (3,0);
      \draw[black, ->] (O)--(A) node[midway, sloped, above left] {$ r $};
      \draw[black] (O) +(0:.8cm) arc (0:33.69:.9cm);
      \draw[black] (O) +(15:.6) node[rotate=0] {$ \theta $};
      \draw[black] (B) -- (A) node[midway, right] {$ b $};
      \draw[black] (O) -- (B) node[midway, above] {$ a $};
    \end{axis}
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{The polar form of a complex number.}
\end{figure}

It is simple to see that $ \theta = \tan^{-1}{\frac{b}{a}} $; we have already got a formula for $ r $.

This new notation simplifies multiplication significantly, because you will show as an exercise that
\begin{displaymath}
  (r \cis \theta)(t \cis \varphi) = (rt) \cis (\theta + \varphi).
\end{displaymath}

For example, if we were to multiply $ 3 \cis \pi $ by $ 4 \cis \pi $, we would obtain $ 12 \cis 2\pi = 12 $. This is as expected,
as $ p \cis \pi = -p $, and $ -3 \times -4 = 12 $.

Note that any complex number has an infinite number of different representations in polar form, simply by adding $ 2\pi $ (an entire
rotation around the origin) to its argument. This fact comes into play later on when we try to solve equations involving powers of complex
numbers.

\subsection*{Exponentiation}
Finally, we ask ourselves what a definition of complex exponentiation should be. There are two important
behaviours of the real exponential function which we want to preserve: the sum-to-product rule ($ \exp(x + y) = \exp(x) \exp(y) $)
and the differentiation rule ($ \exp'(x) = \exp(x) $).

If we define the complex exponential in such a way that these rules hold, then we will have $ \exp(x + iy) = \exp(x) \exp(iy) $;
in particular, we need only make a sensible definition for $ \exp(iy) $. Further, we have already seen a function that satisfies the sum
rule: $ \cis(x + y) = \cis(x) \cis(y) $. Thus, we make a guess that a decent definition for our exponential function will be $ \exp(iy) = \cis(y) $.

We now check that this definition satisfies the differentiation rule: we have not formally defined how differentiation should work over the
complex numbers, but $ \cis $ is only a function of real variables and so we can differentiate it using our normal definitions:
\begin{displaymath}
  \od{}{y} [\cos y + i\sin y] = -\sin y + i\cos y = i(i\sin y + \cos y) = i\cis y.
\end{displaymath}
Thus, if we make this definition, then $ \exp(iy) = i\exp(iy) $ which is the `usual' rule for exponent differentiation.

We therefore make the definition formally, known as \emph{Euler's formula}, that
\begin{displaymath}
  \cis \theta = \exp(i\theta)
\end{displaymath}
and thus
\begin{displaymath}
  \exp(x + iy) = e^x \cis y;
\end{displaymath}
we will also allow ourselves to use the standard notation, $ \exp(z) = e^z $.

Philosophically, we make the note that complex exponentiation is very elegant, in the sense that it
is simply a function which transforms numbers from rectangular form into polar form by `wrapping them
around the origin'!

From Euler's formula we obtain the following equation, which relates five fundamental mathematical constants
in one expression and which some have called the most beautiful equation in mathematics:
\begin{equation}
  \tag{Euler's Identity}
  e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0.
\end{equation}

  Algebra is the offer made by the devil to the mathematician... All you need to do, is give me your soul: give up geometry.
\end{aquote}
We have already seen that we can view the complex numbers as points in the plane, $ \mathbb{R}^2 $. This means
that we can carry out geometric operations algebraically using complex numbers. For example, the length of the line joining two
points $ z_1 $ and $ z_2 $ is simply $ \abs{z_1 - z_2} $.

We define the \textit{locus} of an equation to be the set of all points satisfying that equation; for example, the locus
of $ x^2 + y^2 = 1 $ is the set of all points making up the unit circle. We can use our correspondence between points on
a plane and complex numbers to reason about the locus of a complex equation; for example, the locus of the equation $ \abs{z} = 1 $
is the set of all points at a unit distance from the origin: it is another way of talking about the unit circle. (If you
write $ z = x + iy $, then $ \abs{z} = x^2 + y^2 $ and the comparison becomes even more obvious.)

More interestingly, consider the set of all points $ z $ such that for some real number $ t $ and for a pair of fixed
points $ z_1 $ and $ z_2 $, $ z = tz_1 + (1 - t)z_2 $. The locus of this set is the line joining $ z_1 $ and $ z_2 $.
To prove this, write $ z = x + iy $, $ z_1 = x_1 + iy_1 $, and $ z_2 = x_2 + iy_2 $; then the equation tells us that
\begin{gather*}
  x + yi = tx_1 + it y_1 + x_2 + i y_2 - tx_2 - it y_2\\
  x = t(x_1 - x_2) + x_2, \qquad y = t(y_1 - y_2) + y_2
\end{gather*}
From the second line, we see that $ t = \frac{x - x_2}{x_1 - x_2} $ and thus
\begin{gather*}
  y = \frac{x - x_2}{x_1 - x_2}(y_1 - y_2) + y_2.
\end{gather*}
Writing $ m = \frac{y_1 - y_2}{x_1 - x_2} $, we see that we have the equation of a line passing through $ (x_2, y_2) $
with slope $ m $.

Now, we will consider two non-zero complex numbers $ w $ and $ z $; we will call the two points \textit{orthogonal} if the lines
passing from $ w $ and $ z $ to the origin meet at right angles (for example, \cref{fig:orthogonal}).

  \caption{Two orthogonal points, $ 3\cis(120^\circ) $ and $ 3\cis(210^\circ) $.\label{fig:orthogonal}}
\end{figure}


The claim is that the two points are orthogonal precisely when $ \realp w \realp z + \imagp w \imagp z = 0 $. To prove this, we need to show
two things:
\begin{itemize}
  \item if $ w $ and $ z $ are orthogonal then the condition holds; and
  \item if the condition holds for the $ w $ and $ z $ then they are orthogonal.
\end{itemize}

Suppose first that the two points are orthogonal; then, by Pythagoras' theorem, we have that $ \abs{w - z}^2 = \abs{w}^2 + \abs{z}^2 $.
Expanding this, we obtain
\begin{align*}
  (w - z)(\overline{w} - \overline{z}) &= w\overline{w} + z\overline{z}\\
  z\overline{w} + w\overline{z} &= 0.
\end{align*}
But $ z\overline{w} + w\overline{z} = z \overline{w} + \overline{z \overline{w}} $, and hence (applying exercise \ref{sec:complex1}.\ref{ex:reflecsum})
we have $ 2 \realp{z \overline{w}} = 0 $. But $ \realp{z \overline w} = \realp{z}\realp{w} + \imagp{z} \imagp{w} $, and so the condition
claimed holds.

On the other hand, suppose $ \realp{z}\realp{w} + \imagp{z} \imagp{w} = 0 $. We form the triangle with sides $ \abs{w} $, $ \abs{z} $,
and $ \abs{w - z} $ with an angle $ \theta $ at the origin. By the cosine rule, $ \abs{w - z}^2 = \abs{w}^2 + \abs{z}^2 - 2\abs{w}\abs{z}\cos\theta $.
Using the same argument as above, we have $ z\overline{w} + w\overline{z} = - 2\abs{w}\abs{z}\cos\theta $; but the left hand side
is zero, and thus (since $ \abs{w} $ and $ \abs{z} $ are non-zero) we have $ \cos \theta = 0 $ and $ \theta = \pm \pi/2 $ as claimed.

We call the expression $ \realp w \realp z + \imagp w \imagp z $ the \emph{dot product} of $ w $ and $ z $; we write it $ (w, z) $. One
important property of the dot product is that $ (u + v, w) = (u, w) + (v, w) $.

The dot product is intimately connected with the geometry of the complex plane. As well as our result about orthogonality above,
we have two more properties:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The modulus of $ z $ is $ \abs{z} = \sqrt{(z, z)} $.
  \item If $ \theta $ is the angle at the origin between $ w $ and $ z $ (i.e. $ \theta = \arg w - \arg z $), then $ \cos \theta = \frac{(w,z)}{\abs{w}\abs{z}} $.
\end{enumerate}

Suppose we have two nonzero complex numbers, $ w_0 $ and $ z_0 $. We want to find the closest point $ z $ on the line generated by $ z_0 $
(i.e. the line passing through $ z_0 $ and the origin) to the point $ w_0 $. This point is called the \emph{projection} of $ w_0 $ onto $ z_0 $,
and we denote it by $ z = \proj_{z_0}(w_0) $.

The calculation of the projection is based on the dot product, and proceeds as follows. Consider $ h = w_0 - tz_0 $, where $ t $ is some
real number. Then $ (h, z_0) = (w_0, z_0) - (tz_0, z_0) = (w_0, z_0) - t\abs{z_0}^2 $; so $ h $ is perpendicular to $ tz_0 $ precisely
when $ t = \frac{(w_0, z_0)}{\abs{z_0}^2} = \frac{(w_0, z_0)}{(z_0, z_0)} $. It follows that
\begin{displaymath}
  \proj_{z_0}(w_0) = z_0 \frac{(w_0, z_0)}{(z_0, z_0)}.
\end{displaymath}
This result tells us that the geometric meaning of the dot product $ (a,b) $ is just the length of the `shadow' cast onto $ a $
by $ b $, multiplied by the squared length of $ a $. But the dot product is symmetric, so this is also the length of the `shadow' cast onto $ b $
by $ a $, multiplied by the squared length of $ b $. If both $ a $ and $ b $ have length 1, then this length is just the cosine of
the angle between them. (See \cref{fig:projection}.)

  \caption{The projection of $ b $ onto $ a $. From \url{http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/DotProduct.aspx}.\label{fig:projection}}
\end{figure}

As a bonus, if we are given any fixed complex number $ z_0 $ then we can write every vector $ w_0 $ in the plane in the form $ w_0 = tz_0 + z_0^\perp $
where $ z_0 $ and $ z_0^\perp $ are perpendicular: just take $ t = \frac{(w_0, z_0)}{(z_0, z_0)} $ and $ z_0^\perp = w_0 - tz_0 $.

Another important geometric property of the complex numbers is the triangle inequality; if $ a $ and $ b $ are
complex numbers, then $ \abs{a + b} \leq \abs{a} + \abs{b} $. Geometrically, this just states that if two sides
of a triangle have lengths $ \abs{a} $ and $ \abs{b} $ then the third side has length at most $ \abs{a} + \abs{b} $ (\cref{fig:triangleineq}).

                  exactly 90\degree left and walk the same number of steps to the point $ g' $. Returning
                  to the statue, walk to the beech tree (again counting your steps). Turn right by 90\degree,
                  and walk the same number of steps to point $ g'' $. The treasure is buried exactly at the midpoint
                  of the line joining $ g' $ and $ g'' $.

        and $ (x_1, y_1) $ in $ \mathbb{C}^2 $, there is a \textbf{unique} line through those two points. \textit{Hint: it is certainly \textbf{not} true

\section{Roots of Unity}\label{sec:roots}
Let us take the equation $ z^3 = 1 $. We know that this equation has exactly three complex
roots, and of these we already know that the only real root is $ z = 1 $. How can we find
the two non-real roots?

Noting that $ 1 = 1 \cis 2k\pi $ for all natural numbers $ k $, we can apply de~Moivre's~Theorem
to show that $ 1^{(\frac{1}{3})} = \cis \frac{2k\pi}{3} $.

We can then set $ n $ to 0, 1, and 2 to obtain our three roots of the original
equation: $ z = 1 $, $ z = \cis \frac{2\pi}{3} $, and $ z = \cis \frac{4\pi}{3} $
respectively. Note that if we set $ k $ to any higher number (3, for example) we
obtain one of the roots we already have (e.g. $ \cis \frac{6\pi}{3} = 1 $), since we
have gone `around the circle'.

  \caption{The cube roots of 1.\label{fig:cuberoots}}
\end{figure}

If we look at the roots geometrically (on an Argand diagram like that in \cref{fig:cuberoots}), we see that
the $ n$th roots of 1 will be arranged in a circle of radius $ 1 $ centred on the origin, and the
angles between them will be exactly $ \frac{2\pi}{n} $. If $ n $ is even, both 1 and -1 will both
be real roots, but if $ n $ is odd then 1 will be the only real root. In general, the sum of all
$ n $ $n$th roots of unity is zero (see exercise \ref{ex:rootsum}).

Any integer power of an $n$th root of unity is also an $n$th root of unity. However, not
all $ n$th roots will "generate" all the other ones in this way; for example, $ \cis \frac{2\pi}{3} $
is a sixth root of unity but will miss out every second sixth root if we raise it to integer
powers. Roots which \emph{do} generate all the others are called \emph{primitive roots of unity}.

We formally define a primitive $n$th root of unity to be a complex number $ \omega $ such that $ \omega^n = 1$
but $ \omega^k \neq 1 $ for all $ k < n $. In other words, if we list all the roots of unity in order for $ n = 1,~2,~3 $
and so on, then a root is only primitive for that value of $ n $ for which it first appears.

For example, $ \mu = \cis \frac{2\pi}{3} $ is a primitive third root of unity (since the smallest
nonzero $ n $ such that $ \mu^n = 1 $ is $ n = 3 $).

We now prove that, as we claimed, the primitive $n$th roots of unity "generate" all the other
$ n$th roots of unity:
\begin{thm}
  Given the polynomial $ z^n = 1 $, with primitive root $ \omega $, all solutions
  are given by $ \omega^k $ for $ 0 \leq k \leq (n - 1) $. In other words,
  the integer powers of a primitive $ n$th root of unity must be \emph{all} the
  $n$th roots of unity.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  We first prove that all the powers $ \omega^k $ for $ k $ defined above are distinct.
  Suppose that there are two values for $ k $, say
  $ k = a $ and $ k = b $, such that $ \omega^a = \omega^b $ and $ a \neq b $. Then we have
  that $ \omega^{a-b} = 1 $ and therefore $ a - b = 0 $ (the other possibility here would be
  that $ a - b $ were equal to some non-zero multiple of $ n $, none of which are possible
  values of $ k $) so $ a = b $.

  Since there are $ n $ possible values for $ k $, there are $ n $ distinct powers of $ \omega $
  which are all roots of the polynomial. However, the polynomial is of degree $ n $ and so has
  exactly $ n $ roots --- thus, the powers of $ \omega $ are exactly the roots of the polynomial.
\end{proof}

Roots of unity allow us to find all the $ n$th roots of any number easily. Suppose $ a^n = x $; then
the $ n$th roots of $ x $ will be $ a = \omega^k \sqrt[n]{x} $ ($ 0 \leq k < n $) where $ \omega $ is a
primitive $ n$th root of unity and $ \sqrt[n]{x} $ is any $ n$th root of $ x $.

For the exercises marked $ \dagger $, it may be useful to use the result that for all integers $ a $ and $ b $
there exist integers $ m $ and $ n $ such that $ am + bn = \gcd(a,b) $ (where the $ \gcd $ of two numbers is the
largest integer that divides into both of them). Two integers $ a $ and $ b $ are coprime if they share

\section{The Double-Triangle Problem}\label{sec:triangle}
As an application of our work on primitive roots, we solve the \emph{double-triangle problem} which appeared
in the 2009 New Zealand Scholarship examination.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{double_triangle}
\end{center}

The question states that the positive real solution is $ z_1 = k = k \cis 0 $. We
can therefore see that the other two solutions on the outer circle will be given
by $ z_2 = k \cis \frac{2\pi}{3} $ and $ z_3 = k \cis \frac{-2\pi}{3} $.

The negative real solution will have the same real part as the two complex solutions
on the outer circle; we can calculate this by taking $ z_4 = k \cos \frac{2\pi}{3} = -\frac{k}{2} $.
We can find the other two solutions on the inside circle by rotating our negative
real solution by $ \frac{2\pi}{3} $, obtaining $ z_5 = \frac{k}{2} \cis (\pi - \frac{2\pi}{3}) = \frac{k}{2} \cis \frac{\pi}{3} $
and $ z_6 = \frac{k}{2} \cis \frac{-\pi}{3} $.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular} {c | c | c}
  \textbf{Root} & \textbf{Polar form} & \textbf{Rectangular form}\\
  $ z_1 $ & $ k \cis 0 $                         & $ k $\\
  $ z_2 $ & $ k \cis \frac{2\pi}{3} $            & $ -\frac{k}{2} + i\frac{k\sqrt{3}}{2} $\\
  $ z_3 $ & $ k \cis \frac{-2\pi}{3} $           & $ -\frac{k}{2} - i\frac{k\sqrt{3}}{2} $\\
  $ z_4 $ & $ \frac{k}{2} \cis \pi $             & $ -\frac{k}{2} $\\
  $ z_5 $ & $ \frac{k}{2} \cis \frac{\pi}{3} $   & $ \frac{k}{4} + i\frac{k\sqrt{3}}{4} $\\
  $ z_6 $ & $ \frac{k}{2} \cis \frac{-\pi}{3} $   & $ \frac{k}{4} - i\frac{k\sqrt{3}}{4} $\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

We now generate our polynomial using the techniques described in the section on
quadratic equations:
\begin{align*}
  f(x) &= (x - z_1)(x - z_4) = \left(x -k\right)\left(x + \frac{k}{2}\right)\\
  g(x) &= (x - z_2)(x - z_3) = \left(x - \left(-\frac{k}{2} + i\frac{k\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\right)\left(x - \left(-\frac{k}{2} - i\frac{k\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\right)\\
       &= x^2 - \frac{k}{2}x + \frac{k^2}{4}\\
  h(x) &= (x - z_5)(x - z_6) = \left(x - \left(\frac{k}{4} + i\frac{k\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)\right)\left(x - \left(\frac{k}{4} - i\frac{k\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)\right)\\
       &= x^2 + kx + k^2\\
  \therefore~p(x) &= f(x)g(x)h(x) = \left(x -k\right)\left(x + \frac{k}{2}\right)\left(x^2 - \frac{k}{2}x + \frac{k^2}{4}\right)\left(x^2 + kx + k^2\right)
\end{align*}

Note that because all of the complex roots come in conjugate pairs the imaginary parts
cancel leaving us with a sextic polynomial with real coefficients.

\section{Solving the Cubic}\label{sec:cubic}
This section presents a general solution for the cubic equation similar to the solution
of the quadratic equation given in exercise \ref{sec:quadratic}.\ref{ex:quadratificational}. Be sure to complete that
exercise before reading this section. The general outline of this proof is given in \S14
of \cite{Edw84}.

This particular method of solution was presented first by the French mathematician Alexandre-Th\'eophile Vandermonde
in 1771. However, it is believed that the first person to solve the general cubic equation was the Italian
Scipio de Ferro who passed on at least part of his method to his student Antonio Fior. A solution
was independently discovered at around the same time (in 1535) by Niccolo Fontana (also known as Tartaglia,
the Stammerer), who was conviced to pass them on to another Italian, Girolamo Cardano. Cardano later (in 1545)
published the solution in his book, \emph{Ars Magna}, which also included a solution to the general quartic
by Ludovico Ferrari.

Suppose we have some polynomial $ t^3 - \sigma_1 t^2 + \sigma_2 t - \sigma_3 $ (note the signs
on the coefficients) with the three complex roots (not necessarily distinct) $ x $, $ y $,
and $ z $. So $ \sigma_1 = x + y + z $, $ \sigma_2 = xy + xz + yz $, and $ \sigma_3 = xyz $,
where $ \sigma_n $ is known as the $ n$th elementary symmetric polynomial in $ x $, $ y $, and $ z $.

We note the following three identities:
\begin{align*}
  x^2z + xy^2 + yz^2 + x^2y + xz^2 + y^2z &= \sigma_1\sigma_2 - 3\sigma_3\\
  x^3 + y^3 + z^3 &= \sigma_1^3 - 3(\sigma_1\sigma_2 - 3\sigma_3) - 6\sigma_3\\
  x^2 + y^2 + z^2 &= \sigma_1^2 - 2\sigma_2
\end{align*}

Finally, let $ \alpha $ be a primitive cube root of 1.

\subsection*{Computations for the Solution}
Note first that
\begin{align*}
  x &= \frac{1}{3}\left( (x + y + z) + (x + \alpha y + \alpha^2 z) + (x + \alpha^2 y + \alpha z) \right)\\
    &= \frac{1}{3}\left( (x + y + z) + \sqrt[3]{(x + \alpha y + \alpha^2 z)^3} + \sqrt[3]{(x + \alpha^2 y + \alpha z)^3} \right)\\
    &= \frac{1}{3}\left( \sigma_1 + \sqrt[3]{(x + \alpha y + \alpha^2 z)^3} + \sqrt[3]{(x + \alpha^2 y + \alpha z)^3} \right)
\end{align*}
(remembering that the three cube roots of 1 add to 0).

Now, we must find expressions for $ u = (x + \alpha y + \alpha^2 z)^3 $ and $ v = (x + \alpha^2 y + \alpha z)^3 $ in terms of
the coefficients of the polynomial, $ \sigma_n $. Suppose that we can find $ uv $ and $ u + v $ in terms of the elementary
symmetric polynomials. Then we can find $ u $ and $ v $ using the quadratic formula.

So what are $ uv $ and $ u + v $?

Expanding $ u $ and $ v $ individually, we find
\begin{align*}
  u &= 3(x^2z + xy^2 + yz^2)\alpha^2 + 3(x^2y + xz^2 + y^2z)\alpha + x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + 6xyz, \text{ and}\\
  v &= 3(x^2z + xy^2 + yz^2)\alpha + 3(x^2y + xz^2 + y^2z)\alpha^2 + x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + 6xyz.
\end{align*}

Adding these together, we have
\begin{align*}
  u + v &= &&  3\alpha(x^2z + xy^2 + yz^2 + x^2y + xz^2 + y^2z)\\
        &  &&+ 3\alpha^2(x^2z + xy^2 + yz^2 + x^2y + xz^2 + y^2z)\\
        &  &&+ 12xyz + 2(x^3 + y^3 + z^3)\\
        &= &&3(\alpha + \alpha^2)(\sigma_1\sigma_2 - 3\sigma_3) + 12\sigma_3 + 2(\sigma_1^3 - 3(\sigma_1\sigma_2 - 3\sigma_3) - 6\sigma_3)\\
        &= &&-3(\sigma_1\sigma_2 - 3\sigma_3) + 12\sigma_3 + 2(\sigma_1^3 - 3(\sigma_1\sigma_2 - 3\sigma_3) - 6\sigma_3)\\
        &= &&2\sigma_1^3 - 9\sigma_1\sigma_2 + 27\sigma_3.
\end{align*}

To find $ uv $, we proceed as follows:
\begin{align*}
  (x + \alpha y + \alpha^2 z)(x + \alpha^2 y + \alpha z) &= (xy + xz + yz)\alpha^2 + (xy + xz + yz)\alpha + x^2 + y^2 + z^2\\
                                                         &= (\alpha + \alpha^2)(\sigma_2) + \sigma_1^2 - 2\sigma_2\\
                                                         &= \sigma_1^2 - 3\sigma_2\\
                                                         &\Downarrow\\
                                                      uv &= (\sigma_1^2 - 3\sigma_2)^3.
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Solution}
So, to find the solutions of a cubic equation $ t^3 - \sigma_1 t^2 + \sigma_2 t - \sigma_3 = 0 $:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Calculate:
    \begin{align*}
      u + v &= 2\sigma_1^3 - 9\sigma_1\sigma_2 + 27\sigma_3\\
      uv    &= (\sigma_1^2 - 3\sigma_2)^3
    \end{align*}
  \item Then calculate:
    \begin{displaymath}
      u,v = \frac{(u+v) \pm \sqrt{(u  + v)^2 - 4uv}}{2}
    \end{displaymath}
  \item Hence, we have nine possible solutions (one for each choice of cube root), of
        which three will work in the original equation (trial and error must be used at this point):
    \begin{align*}
      x &= \frac{1}{3}\left( \sigma_1 + \sqrt[3]{u} + \sqrt[3]{v} \right)
    \end{align*}
    Remember that the three cube roots of a number will be $ \sqrt[3]{u} $, $ \alpha\sqrt[3]{u} $,
    and $ \alpha^2 \sqrt[3]{u} $ where $ \alpha $ is a complex cube root of unity.
\end{enumerate}

A variation of this method also solves quartic equations. However, no general solution to the
quintic equation (or any higher degree equation) exists in terms of radicals (terms under a $ \sqrt{} $).
The lack of a general solution for any polynomial with $ \delta > 5 $ was originally proved by Ruffini
and Abel in the early 1800s, and a general study of the symmetries of the roots of polynomials
(the beginnings of Galois theory) was first published (after being rejected twice) by the
French Academy of Sciences in 1843 after their late author \'Evariste Galois was killed in a duel
over a girl in 1832 (at the age of 20). For more historical details, see the introductory chapter
of \cite{Ste15}.

\subsection*{Clearing Up Some Technical Points}
How did we know that $ uv $ and $ u + v $ could be expressed in terms of the elementary
symmetric polynomials (the coefficients)? Well, it so happens that $ uv $ and $ u + v $ are
symmetric in $ x $, $ y $, and $ z $ (this is not hard to check), and we have a theorem due
to Sir Isaac Newton which states that:
\begin{thm}[Fundamental Theorem on Symmetric Polynomials]
  Suppose that $ r_1 $, $ r_2 $, ..., $ r_n $ are the roots of some polynomial. Then every
  symmetric polynomial in $ r_1 $, $ r_2 $, ..., $ r_n $ can be expressed (uniquely) as a polynomial
  in the elementary symmetric functions $ \sigma_1 $, $ \sigma_2 $, ..., $ \sigma_n $.
\end{thm}
Note that the elementary symmetric functions of order $ n $ are simply the coefficients of
the polynomial $ (x - a_1)(x - a_2) \cdots (x - a_n) $. For example, the second-order elementary
symmetric functions are just $ \sigma_1 = a_1 + a_2 $ and $ \sigma_2 = a_1 a_2 $; the third-order
elementary symmetric functions are just $ \sigma_1 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 $, $ \sigma_2 = a_1 a_2 + a_1 a_3 + a_2 a_3 $,
and $ \sigma_3 = a_1 a_2 a_3 $.

Basically, the theorem implies that if we have a symmetric expression in the roots of some polynomial,
then we can write that expression in terms of the coefficients of the polynomial.

One example is the discriminant of a polynomial. We have already met the discriminant of a quadratic, $ \Delta_2 = b^2 - 4ac $;
we can more generally define the discriminant of an $ n$th degree polynomial to be
\begin{displaymath}
\Delta_n [(x - \alpha_1)(x - \alpha_2) \cdots (x - \alpha_n)] = \prod_{i < j}(\alpha_i - \alpha_j)^2
\end{displaymath}
which is obviously symmetric in each $ \alpha_i $.

  \hard Under which conditions will the equation $ x^2 + a(1+i)x + b(1+i) = 0 $ have one or more
        real solutions if both $ a $ and $ b $ are real?
  \item Find the complex number $ z $ which satisfies $ \carg(z - 1 - i) = -\frac{\pi}{6} $ and
        $ \carg(z - 1 + i) = \frac{\pi}{6} $.
  \harder Find all integer values of $ a $ and $ b $ such that $ \frac{a^2+b^2}{ab} $ is an integer.
  \harder Let $ w $ and $ z $ be complex numbers, and let $ u = w + z $ and $ v = w^2 + z^2 $. Prove
          that $ w $ and $ z $ are real \textbf{if and only if} $ u $ and $ v $ are real and $ u^2 \leq 2v$.
  \hard Suppose $ x + \frac{1}{x} = 1 $.
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Show, without calculating $ x $, that we must necessarily have
            \begin{displaymath}
              x^7 + \frac{1}{x^7} = 1
            \end{displaymath}
          \item Calculate the possible values of $ x $ and verify this fact.
        \end{enumerate}
  \harder Calculate $ i^i $.
  \item Let $ \mathbb{R}[\epsilon] $ be the real numbers together with some new element $ \epsilon \neq 0 $ such that $ \epsilon^2 = 0 $.
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Does there exist $ \beta $ in $ \mathbb{R}[\epsilon] $ such that $ \beta \epsilon = 1 $ (i.e. does $ \epsilon $ have a multiplicative
                inverse)?
          \item When does $ (a + b\epsilon)^{-1} $ exist?
          \item Solve $ x^2 - 1 = 2\epsilon $ in $ \mathbb{R}[\epsilon] $.

  \hard Suppose $ p(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^n a_i x^i $ and $ q(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^m b_i x^i $ are polynomials. Show that
        \begin{displaymath}
          p(x) q(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^{m + n} c_i x^i,
        \end{displaymath}
        where each $ c_i $ is a constant. Give an expression for $ c_i $ in terms of the coefficients of $ p(x) $ and $ q(x) $.
  \harder In this exercise, we will prove the division theorem that we stated without proof in section \ref{section:poly}: if $ f $ and $ g \neq 0 $
          are polynomials, then there exist unique polynomials $ q $ and $ r $ such that $ \partial r < \partial g $ and
          \begin{displaymath}
            f(x) = g(x) q(x) + r(x).
          \end{displaymath}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Consider the set $ S $ of all polynomials of the form $ f(x) - g(x) q(x) $ for some polynomial $ q(x) $. Show that $ S $ is non-empty
            (i.e. exhibit some polynomial in $ S $).
      \item Explain why there must be some polynomial in $ S $ with minimal degree (that is, you cannot exhibit an infinite sequence of
            polynomials $ p_1, p_2, ... $ in $ S $ such that $ \partial p_1 > \partial p_2 > \cdots > \partial p_i > \cdots $).
      \item Pick such a polynomial of minimal degree; call it $ r $. Fix also the associated $ q $ (i.e. now we have $ f(x) = g(x) q(x) + r(x) $ for
            our fixed $ r $ and $ q $). Show that if $ \partial r \geq \partial g $, then it is possible to construct another polynomial in $ S $ with
            lower degree than $ r $. Conclude that $ \partial r < \partial g $.
      \item Show that $ q $ and $ r $ are uniquely determined by $ f $ and $ g $.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Take the polynomial $ x^2 = 4 $ in the integers modulo 6 (i.e. the integers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
        such that $ 5 + 1 = 0 $). Solve for all possible values of $ x $.
  \item \textbf{Bonus exercise I:} In general, what numbers will work in the place of $ 3 $ and $ 9 $ in the XKCD
        comic at the bottom of the bibliography?
  \item \textbf{Bonus exercise II:} Notice that $ \frac{3}{16} - \frac{3}{19} = \frac{3}{16} \cdot \frac{3}{19} $.
        For which values of $ a $, $ b $, and $ d $ is the identity $ \frac{a}{b} - \frac{a}{d} = \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{a}{d} $ true?
