\chapter{Preface for the navigator}
These notes are my second attempt at a coherent introduction to calculus at the level of NCEA
Level 3 and NZ Scholarship.

I have made a few philosophical changes from the first edition:-
\begin{itemize}
  \item I treat anti-differentiation at the same time as differentiation. (I do introduce the $ \rint $ notation
        and the term `indefinite integral' here, though I would rather not.)
  \item The notes are split into ``topic'' chapters: \textit{The basics} (the basic formal manipulations
        of derivatives and anti-derivatives), \textit{Geometry of curves} (studying curves via differentiation),
        \textit{Geometry of spaces} (definite integrals, the fundamental theorem of calculus, and arc lengths,
        surface area, and volumes), and \textit{Motion and change} (differential equations).
  \item I have dropped many of the proofs; my justification for this change is threefold(!). Firstly,
        the students that `need' the proofs will see them in a Stage I university course. Secondly, many
        of the proofs in elementary calculus often obscure a nugget of geometry behind the formal manipulation
        of limits, and so I would rather include intuitive geometric \emph{justifications} for results in the
        space the proofs formerly were. Finally, most students at Level 3 are simply not ready for proofs: either
        they don't understand why proof is required, or their level of mathematical sophistication means that
        the proofs seem esoteric. I have included copious references to textbooks where proofs can be found.
\end{itemize}

I feel the need also to point out that these notes are incredibly geometric. \emph{If you don't like teaching geometry, these are not the notes for you.}

\section{Prerequisite material}
Firstly, a hard fact: for a student to be successful in L3 calculus, they should have
a good understanding of the material at L2 and earlier (I would generally expect that
students with less than a merit in the level 2 algebra standard will struggle).

In these notes, I will use material from algebra and geometry at L2 or earlier liberally;
I try to point it out when I use some of the more obsure results. I do not use any
material from any of the level three standards, except trigonometry.

So, in general, the prerequisites and expectations for these notes are:-
\begin{itemize}
  \item A good understanding of L2 coordinate geometry and algebra.
  \item A decent understanding of L3 trigonometry, \emph{including the manipulation of identities}.
\end{itemize}

For some of the sections, knowledge of a little physics (L1 and/or L2) would be nice. I cover
the material in the L2 calculus standard quickly so this is not formally a prerequisite, but a student
who doesn't understand the material there well will struggle with these notes. Roughly speaking,
the differentiation material there is more important.

I would strongly recommend revising the material on functions (section 4 of my own level 2 notes).

\section{Recommended textbooks}
I have used the following textbooks when writing these notes, in roughly increasing order of sophistication:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Calculus made easy}, by Sivanus P. Thompson and Martin Gardner. This book is perhaps at the correct level mathematically speaking
        for a Y12/13 student, but it is not very geometric. It is certainly worth looking at, though.
  \item \emph{Calculus}, by James Stewart. This is one of the standard first-year computational calculus books. It has many examples and many exercises,
        but lacks soul.
  \item \emph{Calculus}, by Michael Spivak. This is often called the `One True Calculus Book',\footnote{For example, by the \emph{Chicago undergraduate
        mathematics bibliography}: \url{https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~abhishek/chicmath.htm} (somewhat useful, if taken with a grain of salt).} but
        is more properly an introduction to real analysis. As such, it is too diffcult for all but the most motivated high school students.
  \item (For the sake of completeness,) \emph{Advanced Calculus}, by L. H. Loomis and S. Sternberg. This is the author's favourite calculus
        book, but is eminently unsuitable for high school students of any motivation. It is incredibly geometric, wonderfully well written, and
        almost impenetrable. This book inspired these notes, philosophically speaking.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Preface for the student}
\begin{figure}

I don't have much to say, really. I could spend time explaining why calculus is useful, but I won't do that here because we'll see
a lot of examples of calculus `in the wild' as we progress (just as a taster, we'll look at some physics, some biology, some economics,
and maybe even some statistics). I could equally well spend time trying to explain exactly what calculus \emph{is} exactly, but this
page is not large enough to contain such an exposition.

Instead, I will give some study advice.

Firstly, you must read the notes. You must sleep with them beneath your pillow. You must work through the examples yourself. You must
do all the problems. You must ask questions.

Because no student ever follows my first piece of advice, I will give you a second, easier option. For each topic, there are a few
homework problems set. \emph{At a minimum}, you should do all these problems. (But beware, if you \emph{only} do these problems, you
will be woefully underprepared for any situation you need calculus for.)

Secondly, draw pictures. I do my best to include lots of diagrams (some even in colour!), but one can never have too many
pictures. (As a young girl called Alice once perceptively remarked, ``What is the use of a book without pictures or
conversations?''\footnote{\emph{Alice in Wonderland}, by Lewis Carroll.})

Thirdly, and I cannot stress this enough, \emph{your exam grades do not matter}.$^\textit{[citation needed]}$ It is perfectly possible to pass calculus exams
without understanding the material, but if you do that (by, for example, trying to memorise everything in leu of understanding it),
you are cheating yourself out of an education. If you understand the material, you will be prepared for every subject you may wish
to take next year (and, as a bonus, you'll pass the exam).

Let us begin.
