\mainHeaderIntg{22}{Lengths, Volumes, and Areas}
\goals{To use an integral as a fancy sum.}
Recall that the definite integral is simply a way of calculating the area bounded by a curve. We defined
it to be an infinite sum of areas under the curve that individually tended to zero.

Today we will investigate finding volumes, curve lengths, and areas of surfaces by integration.

\subsection*{Curve Lengths}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{arclength}
\end{center}
Suppose we have a function $ f $ and we wish to find the length \textit{measured along the curve}
between two points $ a $ and $ b $. Split the interval into pieces of length $ \Delta x $; then the
arc length over each subdivision is approximated by $ \sqrt{\Delta x^2 + (f'(x_i^\ast) \Delta x)^2 } $ where $ x_i $ is
a point inside the subdivisioon. We therefore have the sum over the whole interval $ (a,b) $ (where the total number
of subdivisions is $ n $):
\begin{displaymath}
  \sum_{i = 0}^n \sqrt{\Delta x^2 + (f'(x_i^\ast) \Delta x)^2 } = \sum_{i = 0}^n \sqrt{1 + (f'(x_i^\ast))^2} \Delta x.
\end{displaymath}

But if we let $ n \to \infty $, this is exactly the following integral:
\begin{displaymath}
  R = \rint^b_a \sqrt{1 + (f'(x))^2} \dif{x}.
\end{displaymath}

\begin{ex}
  We wish to find the length along the curve $ y = \ln \cos x $ along the interval $ (0, \pi/3) $. We have the
  following integral (noting that $ y' = -\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = -\tan x $):
  \begin{align*}
    R = \rint^{\pi/3}_0 \sqrt{1 + \tan^2 x} \dif{x} &= \rint^{\pi/3}_0 \sec x \dif{x}
                                                     = \rint^{\pi/3}_0 \frac{\sec^2 x + \sec x \tan x}{\sec x + \tan x} \dif{x}
                                                    = \rint^{2 + \sqrt{3}}_{1} \frac{1}{u} \dif{u}
                                                     =  \ln(2 + \sqrt{3}) \approx 1.3170.
  \end{align*}
  \textit{The integral of $ \sec $ is tricky; it can also be done by partial fractions (multiply top and bottom of $ 1/\cos x $
          by $ \cos x $ and substitute $ u = \sin x $).}
\end{ex}

\subsection*{Volumes of Revolution}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{revs}
\end{center}
We can carry out the same procedure to find a volume of revolution; the volume of each small disc can be approximated
with $ \pi [f(x_i^\ast)]^2 \Delta x $, and so we have
\begin{align*}
  V &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=0}^n \pi [f(x_i^\ast)]^2 \Delta x\\
    &= \rint_a^b \pi [f(x)]^2 \dif{x}.
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Surface Areas of Revolution}
We can model the surface area of revolution of a curve is similarly found by modelling the volume as a disc of
radius $ f(x_i^\ast) $ and length $ \sqrt{1 + (f'(x_i^\ast))^2} \Delta x $:
\begin{align*}
  A &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=0}^n 2\pi f(x_i^\ast) \sqrt{1 + (f'(x_i^\ast))^2} \Delta x\\
    &= \rint_a^b 2\pi f(x) \sqrt{1 + (f'(x))^2} \dif{x}.
\end{align*}
