\mainHeaderDiffHw{2}{Limits}
\subsection*{Reading}
You may be wondering why we bother introducing the concept of limits: after all, we are simply replacing one handwavy picture-based definition (that
of the derivative) with another! I will give the answer in two parts:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Limits are a more general and hence more useful concept; and
  \item It is much easier to formally define a limit than a derivative.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Limits are more general}
The obvious use of limit notation this year is to `plug gaps' in functions; however, we can also (as you have seen) take limits of things towards
infinity. This allows us to formalise things like infinite sums: we define the value of an infinite sum to be a special kind of limit.

Limiting situations come up surprisingly often in physics and chemistry as well, if we want to look at the behaviour of a system in the long term:
say the concentration of a particular compound in solution can be modelled by $ C(t) = \frac{k}{t^2} $; then, if we wait a long time (i.e. let $ t \to \infty $),
we predict that the concentration becomes negligible.

\subsubsection*{It is easier to formally define a limit}
Suppose that we have some function $ f $ such that
\begin{displaymath}
  \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L.
\end{displaymath}

All we are saying here is (intuitively) that we can make the value of $ f $ \emph{as close as we like} to being $ L $, by taking $ x $ to be sufficiently close
to $ a $. I will not state the formal definition here (it is easy enough to find), except to state that it is a little stricter than this intuitive statement
suggests (i.e. for all $ x \neq a $ within the interval $ (a - \delta, a + \delta) $ we must have $ f(x) $ be within $ (L - \varepsilon, L + \varepsilon) $).

\subsection*{Questions}
Derivatives and limits allow us to classify functions and their behaviour. Consider the following:
\subsubsection*{Properties of Functions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A function is \textbf{increasing} if its derivative is positive.
  \item A function is \textbf{decreasing} if its derivative is negative.
  \item A function is \textbf{concave down} if its derivative is decreasing.
  \item A function is \textbf{concave up} if its derivative is increasing.
  \item A function $ f $ is \textbf{continuous} at a point $ a $ if $ \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a) $.
\end{itemize}

\begin{questions}
  \question Describe all the function properties given above geometrically, and give an example of each.
  \question Consider the function graphed below.

    \begin{parts}
      \item Find $ \lim_{x \to -2} f(x) $ and $ \lim_{x \to 2} f(x) $.
      \item Does $ \lim_{x \to -3} f(x) $ exist? Why/why not?
      \item Does $ \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) $ exist? Why/why not?
      \item On what intervals is $ f(x) $ continuous?
      \item At what points is $ f(x) $ not differentiable?
    \end{parts}
  \question On an axis, sketch a graph of some function $ f $ that has the following features:
            \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
              \item Is continuous for $ 0 < x < 5 $ and $ 5 < x < 9 $ and is discontinuous when $ x = 5 $
              \item Is concave down ($f''(x) < 0 $) for $ 0 < x < 5 $
              \item Has $ f'(x) = 0 $ at $ (3, 8) $
              \item Has $ \lim_{x \to 5} f(x) = 6 $.
              \item Is not differentiable at $ (7, 3) $.
            \end{itemize}
