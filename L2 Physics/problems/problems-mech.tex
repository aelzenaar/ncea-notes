              are the units of the gravitational constant $ G $?
    \question Suppose a horizontal spring is fixed at one end, and a mass is attached to the other end in such a way that it is free
              to move back and forth along some surface, stretching and compressing the string. Suppose the mass is gently pulled

              at the other end) to be thrown into the air. When Jess lands on the see-saw, Hannah is thrown into
              the air at a speed of \SI{15.0}{\metre\per\second}, at an angle of \ang{70} to the horizontal.
      \begin{parts}
        \part Calculate the time that Hannah takes to reach the highest point of her trajectory.
        \part When Hannah takes off, the horizontal component of her velocity is \SI{5.1}{\metre\per\second}. State the
              size and direction of her velocity at the highest point. Explain your answer.

    \question (NZQA 2013) Hillary attempts to throw a basketball into a hoop.
      \begin{parts}
        \part Explain the effect of the force(s) acting on the ball, once it has left
              Hilaryâ€™s hand until it reaches maximum height. You may ignore the effects of air resistance.
        \part On another occasion, Hillary stands 3.0 metres from the hoop. She throws a ball with an initial
              velocity of \SI{6.5}{\metre\per\second} at an angle of \ang{60} to the horizontal. The hoop is \SI{1.35}{\metre}
              above the bottom of the ball when it is thrown initially. Carry out calculations to determine whether
              or not the ball will go through the hoop. Begin your answer by calculating the horizontal and vertical
              components of the initial velocity of the ball.

    \question Jeremy throws a ball horizontally at a speed of \SI{15.0}{\metre\per\second}. It is initially at a height of
              \SI{2.00}{\metre}. Draw a free-body diagram of force(s) acting on the ball at the instant it is thrown. How
              far does it travel?
    \question In the situation pictured below, a stunt driver wishes to shoot off the incline and land on the platform. What is
              the minimum speed the driver needs to move at in order to succeed?

    \question A projectile is shot from the ground with a velocity $ u $ at an angle $ \alpha $ with the horizontal. It returns
              to the ground at a distance $ R $ from the initial point. Show that, if friction is negligible, then
              \begin{displaymath}
                R = \frac{2u^2 \sin \alpha \cos \alpha}{g};
              \end{displaymath}
              given that $ 2 \sin \alpha \cos \alpha = \sin 2\alpha $, show that the range is maximised when $ \alpha = \ang{45} $.

    \question In the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, an electron is modelled as rotating in a circle (with radius \SI{0.5e-10}{\metre})
              about the positively charged nucleus of the atom.
      \begin{parts}
        \part What force furnishes the centripetal force which causes the electron to be trapped?
        \part The mass of an electron is \SI{9e-31}{\kilo\gram}, and the speed of an electron is modelled as \SI{2.3e6}{\metre\per\second}.
              How strong is the centripetal force?
        \part There is a significant issue with this model. What is it? [Hint 1: there is a conservation law being violated. Which, and why?]
        \part There is a subtle issue with the argument in (c). What is it? [Hint 2: Unpack $ \Delta E = F \Delta x $.] (Note: nonetheless, this
              argument --- when sufficiently patched up --- does disprove the Bohr model of the atom.)\footnote{See Griffiths, \emph{Intro. to Electrodynamics},
              \S11.}

    \question (NZQA 2016) A toy red car was going round a circular part of the track at a constant speed.

              \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{nzqa20162}

      \begin{parts}
        \part Name the force acting on the car, and draw a labelled vector on the diagram above to
              show the direction of the force acting on the car at the instant shown.
        \part Discuss the effect of the force on the size and direction of the velocity of the red car.

    \question (NZQA 2012) Jess is moving in a circular path on a trapeze. When she gets to the lowest point in her
              swing, the tension force in the rope is greater than the gravity force acting on her. Draw a diagram of the
              forces acting on Jess at this time, and explain why the tension force is greater than the gravity force.
    \question (NZQA 2017) During one of her dance routines, Sally is spinning a ball above her head in a horizontal circle.
              The ball of mass \SI{0.050}{\kilo\gram} makes 5 rotations in \SI{4.0}{\second}. The length of the string
              from the ball to Sallyâ€™s hand is \SI{0.60}.
              Calculate the size of the force experienced by the ball during these rotations.
    \question A ball tied to the end of a string is swing in a vertical circle of radius $ r $ under the action of gravity.
      \begin{parts}
        \part The ball is rotating at a constant speed. Describe the acceleration felt by the ball at the top of the circle.
        \part Draw a free body diagram showing the forces acting on the ball at the top of the circle.
        \part Calculate the tension $ T $ in the string at that point.

    \question The moon orbits the Earth in an approximately circular path of radius \SI{3.8e8}{\metre}. It takes
              about 27 days to complete one circuit. What is the mass of the Earth? (Hint: draw a free body diagram.)
