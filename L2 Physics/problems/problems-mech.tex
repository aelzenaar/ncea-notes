    \question (NCEA 2013) The diagram below represents a see-saw on a pivot at its centre with Jane and her dad sitting on
              opposite sides such that the see-saw is in equilibrium. The mass of the see-saw itself is \SI{60}{\kilo\gram}.

              \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{nzqa201321}
      \begin{parts}
        \part On the diagram above, draw labelled vectors to show all the forces acting on the see-saw.
        \part Jane and her dad move to opposite ends of the see-saw.
              The diagram below shows what happens when Jane sits at one end of the see-saw while her
              dad sits at the other end.

              in terms of $ \theta $, $ m $, and $ f $.
    \question The weight of an object is defined to be the force exerted on it by gravity; so $ W = mg $, where $ m $ is the
              mass of the object. If a three ton (\SI{3000}{\kilo\gram}) car is travelling at \SI{40}{\kilo\metre\per\hour}
              and the brakes are suddenly applied, and it skids to rest, how far does the car skid given that the friction
              force experienced by the tires is around 0.7 times the weight of the car?
    \question Newton's law of gravity tells us that if we have two objects $ A $ and $ B $, with masses $ m_A $ and $ m_b $,
              such that the distance between them is $ r $, then the force that $ A $ exerts on $ B $ due to gravity is
              \begin{displaymath}
                F = \frac{Gm_A m_B}{r^2}.
              \end{displaymath}

              speed is measured as \SI{4}{\metre\per\second}. Calculate $ h $. How long did the object take to fall through the height?
    \question A \SI{2000}{\kilo\gram} car is travelling at \SI{20}{\metre\per\second} up a frictionless hill when the motor stops. (a) If the car
              is a vertical distance of \SI{8}{\metre} from the top of the hill at that point, will it be able to reach the top? (b) How far below
              the top of the hill could the car be to still reach the top?

        \part Hannah doesnâ€™t like the rope to be too tight when she lands on it.
              State the direction of the force on her from the rope.
              Explain, in terms of the force acting on Hannah, why the rope should not be too tight when
              she lands on it.
        \part An elastic rope is suspended from a beam so that it is
              hanging vertically down. Hannah hangs vertically down

    \question (NCEA 2013) Jason is still at some kind of fair. Each bumper car in the fair has a rubber bumper all round it.
      \begin{parts}
        \part The mass of a bumper car is \SI{240}{\kilo\gram}. Jason has a mass of \SI{65}{\kilo\gram} and is
              travelling at a speed of \SI{2.4}{\metre\per\second}. Calculate the size of the momentum of Jason and his bumper car.
        \part The bumper cars are designed to minimise injury.
              Discuss the reasons for the bumper cars having rubber bumpers all round them.
              Assume cars with and without bumpers have the same mass. Assume change in velocity is the
              same with and without bumpers.
        \part Jason collides head-on with Janet who is in another bumper car. The bumpers donâ€™t work
               properly and after collision both cars lock together. The mass of each bumper car is \SI{240}{\kilo\gram}.
               Jason has a mass of \SI{65}{\kilo\gram} and Janet has a mass of \SI{58}{\kilo\gram}. They are travelling towards each
               other in opposite directions, Jason with a speed of \SI{2.4}{\metre\per\second}
               to the right and Janet with a speed of \SI{2.7}{\metre\per\second} to the left.
               Calculate their combined velocity after collision, as a vector.
        \part The rubber bumper in Jasonâ€™s bumper car has a spring constant of \SI{78000}{\newton\per\metre}.
               On one occasion he collides with the wall, causing a compression of \SI{15}{\centi\metre}. Calculate the elastic potential
               energy stored in the rubber bumper, and determine the impulse if the collision lasted for \SI{0.80}{\second} (making sure
               you include a unit with your answer).
      \end{parts}
    \question A car of mass $ m $ rolls from rest down a hill of height $ h $ and length $ L $. Show that when the
              car reaches the bottom it has a speed of
              \[ v = \sqrt{2gh - \frac{2Lf}{m}}. \]
