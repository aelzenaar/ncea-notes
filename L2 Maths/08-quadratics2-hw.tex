  People use quadratic equations for...
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Engineering, economics, and the sciences: modelling situations (a perfect projectile follows a parabolic arc, a parabolic mirror
          reflects all light from the focus into parallel rays and is used in telescopes and radio dishes...)
    \item Mathematics: every polynomial is a product of quadratic and linear factors, and the fact that the quadratic formula even exists
          is actually quite surprising (there is no equivalent to `completing the square' for cubics or anything more complicated).
  \end{itemize}

\subsection*{Questions}
\begin{questions}
  \question Find the nature of the roots of the equation $ x^2 + 3kx - 28 $, if:
    \begin{parts}
      \part $ k < 0 $,
      \part $ k = 0 $, and
      \part $ k > 0 $.
    \end{parts}
  \question Find the values of $ m $ for which one root of the equation $ 4x^2 = mx - 5 $ is thrice the other root.
  \question Suppose the quadratic equation $ x^2 + bx + c = 0 $ has the two roots $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $. Show
            that $ bc = -\alpha^2\beta - \alpha\beta^2 $.
  \question The lengths of three sides of a right-angled triangle are $ x - 2 $, $ 2x $, and $ x + 6 $. If it is
            known that the length of the longest side is $ x + 6 $, compute $ x $ and give the length of the shortest
            side explicitly.
\end{questions}
