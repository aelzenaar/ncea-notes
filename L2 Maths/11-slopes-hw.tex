  People use calculus for...
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Engineering and physics: calculus is the natural language of any system which moves or changes over time (the movement of
          a vehicle or a robot arm, or the current in an electrical system).
    \item Chemistry and biology: rates of reaction and fluid pressure, population growth, and molecular kinetics are all examples of
          systems that are best understood using either calculus or further applications of calculus.
    \item Mathematics: the subjects which grow out of calculus (analysis and topology, for example) are fundamental geometric theories
          of space, distance, and transformation.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection*{Questions}
\begin{questions}
  \question A function $ f $ is given by $ f(x) = 2x^3 - 10x + 5 $. Find the gradient of the graph of $ f $ at the point where $ x = 2 $.
  \question Find the coordinates of the point on the curve $ y = \frac{4}{x^2} $ where the gradient is 1.
  \question Answer the following questions about this graph. Open circles denote locations
            where the function \emph{is not} defined, while filled circles denote locations at
            the end of a segment where the function \emph{is} defined.

    \begin{parts}
      \part What is the slope of the graph at $ x = 8 $?
      \part Does the function have a derivative everywhere (i.e. can you guess the slope of the graph at every point)? If not, where
            does it fail to be differentiable?
      \part At $ x = -5 $, is the derivative positive or negative?
      \part What is the slope of the curve around $ x = 0 $?
    \end{parts}
