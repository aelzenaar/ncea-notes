\subsection*{Basic probability}

Suppose we are performing an experiment where the outcome is uncertain. Some examples
of such experiments include:-
\begin{itemize}
  \item Flipping a coin.
  \item Measuring rainfall.
  \item Determining the sex of a newborn child.
  \item Checking the outcome of a sporting event.
\end{itemize}

The set of possible outcomes of an experiment is called the \emph{sample space}. The
sample space of the first experiment above, that of flipping a coin, is
\begin{displaymath}
  S_\text{coin flip} = \{ H, T \}.
\end{displaymath}

The \emph{probability} of a given outcome is the proportion of times that we would expect
an experiment to give a particular outcome if we run the experiment multiple times. We
write $ P(\text{outcome}) $ for the probability of a particular outcome.

For example, $ P(H) = 0.5 $ because, if we were to flip a coin many times, we would expect
half the tosses to result in an outcome of $ H $.

A probability must lie between $ 0 $ and $ 1 $ inclusive (because it makes no sense for an outcome to happen in 200\% of the
experimental runs).

There are a couple of ways to determine the probability of something. We either find a probability experimentally,
by doing an experiment a bunch of times, or we do it theoretically, by counting outcomes.

\begin{itemize}
  \item To determine a probability experimentally --- based on empirical evidence:
        \begin{displaymath}
          P(A) = \frac{\text{number of times $A$ happened}}{\text{number of times the experiment ran}}.
        \end{displaymath}
  \item If there are $ n $ ways for an outcome $ A $ to occur, and each way is equally likely, then
        \begin{displaymath}
          P(A) = \frac{\text{number of ways $A$ could happen}}{\text{number of ways any outcome could happen}}.
        \end{displaymath}
\end{itemize}

We have some rules to calculate with probabilities. If $ A $ and $ B $ are two possible outcomes,
I will write $ P(A \vee B) $ for the probability that $ A $ \emph{or} $ B $ happens,\footnote{By `$ A $ or $ B $
happens', I mean that one of $ A $, $ B $, or both $ A $ and $  B$ happens.} and $ P(A \wedge B) $ for the
probability that $ A $ \emph{and} $ B $ happens.

If the total sample space consists of $ n $ outcomes, $ S = \{A_1, A_2, ..., A_n\} $, then
\begin{displaymath}
  P(A_1 \vee A_2 \vee \cdots \vee A_n) = 1.
\end{displaymath}
In other words, there is a probability of $ 1 $ --- absolute certainty --- that there will be an outcome. Either
heads or tails must be flipped.\footnote{Yes, it is possible for a coin to land on its rim. I am assuming an infinitely
thin coin, or maybe a counter.}

Two outcomes $ A $ and $ B $ are said to be \emph{mutually exclusive} if they can never happen at the same time;
in other words, if $ P(A \wedge B) = 0 $. To take the example of flipping a coin, heads and tails are mutually
exclusive outcomes.

If two events $ A $ and $ B $ are mutually exclusive, then $ P(A \vee B) = P(A) + P(B) $: the number of times
that $ A $ or $ B $ happens is the sum of the number of times that $ A $ or $ B $ happens.

Suppose $ A $ is an outcome. Then `not $ A $' is an outcome as well. Further, $ A $ and not $ A $ are mutually
exclusive; and they make up an entire sample space for our experiment because if we do the experiment, then either
$ A $ is the outcome or it isn't. Hence $ P(A) + P(\text{not } A) = 1 $, and thus $ P(\text{not } A) = 1 - P(A) $.
To save \sout{chalk} typing, I will write $ \neg A $ for `not $ A $'.

Now, suppose two events $ A $ and $ B $ are \emph{not} mutually exclusive: so it is possible for $ A \wedge B $ to
be an outcome of an experiment. We want to show that $ P(A \vee B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \wedge B) $.

\begin{proof}[Proof 1: via Venn diagram]
  If we draw a Venn diagram showing the $ P(A \wedge B) $, we end up with:

  \begin{center}
    \begin{venndiagram2sets}[labelAB=$A \wedge B $, radius=2.4cm, overlap=1.5cm]
    \end{venndiagram2sets}
  \end{center}
  So we see that $ P(A \vee B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \wedge B) $.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof 2: algebraic]
  First, see that $ A \vee B = A \vee (B \wedge \neg A) $, where these events are mutually exclusive. (Either $ A $
  happens --- which could include $ A $ and $ B $ happening --- or $ B $ happens but not $ A $). We can apply the rule
  from above: $ P(A \vee B) = P(A) + P(B \wedge \neg A) $.

  Now, note that $ B = (B \wedge A) \vee (B \wedge \neg A) $ ($ B $ happens whenever $ B $ and $ A $ both happen, or
  when $ B $ happens without $ A $), where again the events are mutually exclusive. Hence $ P(B) = P(A \wedge B) + P(B \wedge \neg A) $.
  So we have both of the following:
  \begin{gather*}
    P(A \vee B) = P(A) + P(B \wedge \neg A)\\
    P(B) = P(A \wedge B) + P(B \wedge \neg A).
  \end{gather*}
  From the second, $ P(B \wedge \neg A) = P(B) - P(A \wedge B) $; and substituting into the first, $ P(A \vee B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \wedge B) $.
\end{proof}

Two outcomes $ A $ and $ B $ are called \emph{independent} if the the occurrence or nonoccurrence of one
does not affect the likelihood of occurrence or nonoccurence of the other. For example, the events `it will rain tomorrow in Brazil'
and `the sun will rise at 5:30 am in New Zealand' are independent.\footnote{One hopes. It is possible to imagine scenarios where they
turn out not to be independent --- for example, suppose a crazed supervillain from Dunedin decides he will blow up the country if it
rains in Brazil tomorrow.}

Suppose I flip a coin and roll a die. By drawing a table (see below) and counting the outcomes, I find that there
is a 1 in 12 chance ($ P = \frac{1}{12} $) that I flip a heads and roll a 6.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{independence}
\end{center}

Further experimentation should convince you that, if $ A $ and $ B $ are independent, then $ P(A \wedge B) = P(A) P(B) $.

If two events are \emph{not} independent, we can't apply this rule. We can, however, discuss the probability that $ A $ occurs
given that we know $ B $ has happened; we write $ P(A | B) $, read \emph{the probability of $ A $ given $ B $}, for this.

Formally, what we want to know is the proportion of times that $ A $ happens, out of all the times that $ B $ happens; writing
this down, we have
\begin{displaymath}
  P(A | B) = \frac{P(B \wedge A)}{P(B)}.
\end{displaymath}
Instead of our sample space being the entire set of possibilities, we restrict our sample space to just being the set of times $ B $
has occurred, and then we calculate this probability in the usual way.

It is often easier to work out relative probabilities using either a table or a tree diagram.

\begin{ex}[NZQA, 2012]
  BigGen power company keeps track of complaints made to the company by its customers.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 12\% of customers have made a complaint in the last 12 months.
    \item If a customer made a complaint, there was a 0.7 chance that they left BigGen.
    \item The percentage of customers leaving BigGen over the last 12 months was 10\%.
  \end{itemize}
  Calculate the following:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The proportion of customers that complained and left BigGen.
    \item The number of customers that would be expected to complain, but stay with BigGen, given that there were 250,000 customers in total at the start of the year.
    \item The probability that a customer who didnâ€™t complain left BigGen.
    \item If a customer left BigGen, the probability that they complained.
  \end{enumerate}

  \textit{Solution.}
  Consider (1) first. The probability that a customer complained and left can be calculated directly, since
  \begin{displaymath}
    P(\text{complained and left}) = P(\text{left} | \text{complained}) \cdot P(\text{complained}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.12 = 0.084.
  \end{displaymath}
  On the other hand, consider the tree diagram drawn below; the probability $ P(\text{complained and left}) $ can be calculated
  from it by just multiplying down the branch.

  For (2), we need the probability $ P(\text{complained and not left}) $; we can fill in the probability $ P(\text{not left} | \text{complained}) $,
  as it will be $ 1 - P(\text{left} | \text{complained}) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 $. Then $ P(\text{complained and not left}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.12 = 0.036 $.

  For (3), we need $ P(\text{left} | \text{not complained}) $. We know that $ P(\text{left}) = 0.1 $ (it was given); and
  \begin{displaymath}
    P(\text{left and not complained}) + P(\text{left and complained}) = P(\text{left})
  \end{displaymath}
  so $ P(\text{left and not complained}) = 0.1 - 0.084 = 0.016 $; then
  \begin{displaymath}
    P(\text{left} | \text{not complained}) = 0.016/P(\text{not complained}) = 0.016/0.88 = 0.018.
  \end{displaymath}

  Finally, for (4) we want $ P(\text{complained} | \text{left}) $. This is given by $ P(\text{complained and left})/P(\text{left}) $;
  filling this in, $ P(\text{complained} | \text{left}) = 0.084/0.1 = 0.84 $.

  All this information is summarised in the tree diagram above; the circled pieces of information are the ones given, and they
  are sufficient to reproduce the rest. Cover up the example above, and attempt to reproduce the tree diagram yourself using only
  the information given and the probability laws.

  Note that $ P(A | B) \neq P(B | A) $ in general: the probability that someone complained given that they left was 0.84, while
  the probability that someone left given that they complained was 0.7.
\end{ex}

\subsection*{Relative risk}

Suppose we are conducting a medical trial, and we want to examine the differences in outcomes between two groups. For example,
suppose we survey 1000 people and we split them up into two groups according to whether they smoke. We find that 200 people
are smokers, and 800 are non-smokers. We then track them for the rest of their lives, and find that twenty of the smokers
developed lung cancer, and four of the non-smokers did.

\begin{tabular}{|r|c|c|c|}\hline
  & \textbf{Smoker} & \textbf{Non-smoker} & \textbf{Total}\\\hline
  \textbf{Cancer} &20&4&24\\\hline
  \textbf{Non-cancer} &180& 796 & 976 \\\hline
  \textbf{Total} &200&800&1000\\\hline
\end{tabular}

We can't directly compare the actual numbers of cancer sufferers, 4 versus 20, to show that lung cancer and smoking are linked
because the sizes of the cohorts are different: it makes no sense to say that smokers are five times ($ 20/4$) more likely to get cancer
on the basis of these figures. To solve this problem, we want to calculate the risks (probabilities) of lung cancer in the presence
of smoking versus non-smoking, and then compare these.

We learn that, given a person is a smoker, they have a $ 20/200 = 0.1 $ probability of developing
lung cancer. On the other hand, if a person does not smoke, they have a $ 4/800 = 0.005 $ probability
of developing lung cancer. This means that the \emph{relative risk} of lung cancer in the presence
of smoking is $ 0.1/0.005 = 20 $: smokers are twenty times more likely to get lung cancer than non-smokers.

The 2017 NCEA L2 probability exam cites another example; the following table shows data from a sample
of 2500 New Zealanders aged between 15 and 24:

\begin{tabular}{|r|c|c|c|}\hline
  & \textbf{Obese} & \textbf{Non-obese} & \textbf{Total}\\\hline
  \textbf{Male} &222&983&1205\\\hline
  \textbf{Female} &285& 1010 & 1295 \\\hline
  \textbf{Total} &507&1993&2500\\\hline
\end{tabular}

The risk of being obese, given that an individual in the sample is male, is $ 222/1205 = 0.184 $;
the risk of being obese given that an individual is female is $ 285/1295 = 0.220 $. Thus the relative
risk is $ 0.220/0.184 = 1.196 $: if an individual from the sample is female, they are almost 20\% more
likely to be obese than a male from the sample.

Reports like this often generate sensational headlines in the media, and
so it is important to understand how they are calculated and the assumptions made.
