  People use systems of equations for...
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Engineering, and the sciences: if a set of unknown quantities are all interrelated (for example, concentrations in a chemical equilibrium).
    \item Mathematics: solving systems of linear equations is the motivating example for \emph{linear algebra}, which forms the algebraic basis
          of geometry and is itself used in engineering and the sciences for modelling systems.
    \item Computer graphics: finding intersection points of curves is often a problem that needs to be solved in computer graphics systems (e.g.
          working out where a ray of light hits a surface).
  \end{itemize}

\subsection*{Questions}
\begin{questions}
  \question Find all the solutions to the system of equations
    \begin{displaymath}
      \begin{cases}
        4x^2 + 16x + y^2 + 15 = 4xy + 8y\\
        y = 2x + 3.
      \end{cases}
    \end{displaymath}
  \question Graph the above system. If we replace the linear equation with $ y = cx + 3 $, for which values of $ c $ does the
            system have no solutions? Is it possible to pick a value of $ c $ such that the system has exactly one solution?
