\subsection*{Reading}
Please read the following article on political polls in New Zealand prior to the last General Election:

\end{center}
Think about how reasonable the sample methods used are. If you were given a couple of million dollars and asked to produce
your own poll based on a sample of the population, how would you go about this?

Optional: Another interesting blog post on the problems with self-selected samples, and correcting for selection bias, can be found here:
