\subsection*{Exponentials}
A particular species of bacteria reproduces by splitting in two every hour; if we start with one bacterium, after one hour we will
have two; after two hourse, we will have four; after three hours, eight; and after $ n $ hours, we will have
\begin{displaymath}
  2^n := \underbrace{2 \times 2 \times \cdots \times 2}_{n \text{ times}}
\end{displaymath}
bacteria.

In general, equations of the form $ y = a^x $ are called \emph{exponential} equations.

\begin{center}

  \begin{axis}[
    /pgf/number format/1000 sep={},
    axis lines = center,
    xlabel = $ x $,
    ylabel = $ 2^x $

    \addplot[domain = 0:4, color = red, samples = 100] {2^x};
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}}
\end{center}

Last year, we learned that exponents have the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $ a^b \times a^c = \underbrace{a \times a \times \cdots \times a}_{b \text{ times}} \times \underbrace{a \times a \times \cdots \times a}_{c \text{ times}} = \underbrace{a \times a \times \cdots \times a}_{(b + c) \text{ times}} = a^{b + c} $.
  \item $ a^b \div a^c = \underbrace{a \times a \times \cdots \times a}_{b \text{ times}} \div \underbrace{a \div a \div \cdots \div a}_{c \text{ times}} = \underbrace{a \times a \times \cdots \times a}_{(b - c) \text{ times}} = a^{b - c} $.
  \item $ \left(a^b\right)^c = \underbrace{a^b \times a^b \times \cdots \times a^b}_{c \text{ times}} = \underbrace{a \times a \times \cdots \times a}_{bc \text{ times}}  = a^{bc}$.
  \item $ a^1 = a $.
  \item $ a = a^1 = a^{0 + 1} = a^0 a^1 = a^0 a  $, so $ a^0 = 1 $.
\end{enumerate}

Note that we have some danger hiding in the background with these proofs: namely, if the powers are not whole numbers (or zero), they become
meaningless! What does it mean to take 2 multiplied by itself $ \pi $ times? The solution, which we will look at briefly next week, is to define
the function $ x \mapsto a^x $ in a series of steps; we have already defined it when $ x $ is a natural number (or zero), and next week we will
properly define it when $ x $ is an integer or rational number in general. Unfortunately, we won't have the necessary machinery to define it for
any real number until next year.\footnote{~For future reference, this is exercise 11 on the second L3 calculus worksheet.}

\subsection*{Logarithms}
Suppose, on the other hand, we wish to know after how many hours we will have 1024 bacteria: we wish to find $ x $ such
that $ 2^x = 1024 $. This value is called the \emph{logarithm} of $ 1024 $ with respect to 2, and we write $ x = \log_2 1024 $.
In general, we have (as a definition),
\begin{displaymath}
  y = a^x \iff x = \log_a y.
\end{displaymath}
The quantity $ a $ is called the \emph{base}, and is always positive.

Note that the function $ x \mapsto \log_a x $ is the inverse of the function $ x \mapsto a^x $.

\begin{center}
\fbox{\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
    /pgf/number format/1000 sep={},
    axis lines = center,
    xlabel = $ x $,
    ylabel = $ \log_2 x $
  ]
    \addplot[domain = 0:4, color = red, samples = 100] {ln(x)/ln(2)};
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}}
\end{center}

If the base of a logarithm is 10, then we often don't write the base: so $ \log 1000 = 3 $, because $ 10^3 = 1000 $.

The following logarithm laws can be derived from the exponent laws:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $ \log_a x + \log_a y = \log_a xy $
    \item $ \log_a x - \log_a y = \log_a \frac{x}{y} $
    \item $ \log_a x^n = n \log_a x $
    \item $ \log_a 1 = 0 $
    \item $ \log_a a = 1 $
    \item $ \log_b x = \dfrac{\log_a x}{\log_a b} $ (change-of-base)
\end{enumerate}

\begin{ex}
  Some elementary examples:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $ \log_2 x = 10 $ implies that $ 2^{10} = x $ and $ x = 1024 $.
    \item $ \log_x 49 = 2 $ implies that $ x^2 = 49 $ and so $ x = 7 $.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{ex}

Most applications of exponential and logarithmic equations outside of mathematics itself are to
do with rates of change and rates of growth. This is because the rate of change of an exponential
function is itself exponential, and so the exponential function will show up anywhere that a rate
of change of a quantity is related directly to the amount of the quantity.

\begin{ex}
  A computer depreciates continuously in value from \$4699 to \$1500 over a period of 4.25 years. The value in dollars, $ y $, of
  the computer $ t $ years after its value was \$4699 can be modelled by a function of the form
  \begin{displaymath}
    y = Ar^t,
  \end{displaymath}
  where $ r $ is a constant. What is the value of the computer after six years?

  \textit{Solution.} At $ t = 0 $, $ y = 4699 $ and so $ 4699 = Ar^0 = A $. On the other
  hand, we have $ 1500 = Ar^{4.25} = 4699 \cdot r^{4.25} $. Hence
  \begin{gather*}
    \frac{1500}{4699} = r^{4.25}\\
    \log \frac{1500}{4699} = \log r^{4.25}\\
    \log \frac{1500}{4699} = 4.25 \log r\\
    r = 10^{\left(\frac{1}{4.25} \log \frac{1500}{4699} \right)} \approx 0.76.
  \end{gather*}
  Here, we used $ \log $ base 10 because it happens to be on the calculator (we could have used any base); we then plugged
  the numbers into the calculator without worrying too much what powers that are fractions `mean' (we'll discuss them next week).
  In the end, we found that a model for the value of the computer after $ t $ years is $ y = 4699 \cdot 0.76^t $, and so
  after six years the computer is worth only around \$905.5.

Prior to the invention of the electronic calculator, mechanical devices called \emph{slide rules} (see picture) were used
by those who needed to make computations with large numbers. These devices consisted of two logarithmic scales next to each
other, labelled with numbers; then the multiplication of $ a $ and $ b $ could be done by finding the lengths $ \log a $
and $ \log b $ on the slide rule, adding the two lengths together, and then using the rule $ \log a + \log b = \log(ab) $
to read off the answer.

  The water receded and the Ark came to rest upon the land. Noah opened the doors and commanded the
  animals, ``Go forth and multiply.'' The animals slowly departed the Ark except for two snakes that
  remained in the back. Again Noah proclaimed ,``Go forth and multiply'' yet the two snakes did not move.
  Noah walked to the back of the Ark and asked, ``Why have you not followed my command?''. The snakes
  answered, ``Noah, we cannot, because we are adders.''

  Noah then went out upon the land and felled several large trees; from these trees he made a four legged
  platform. He then went inside the Ark and carried the snakes outside and upon placing them on the platform,
  his words became true.

  As everyone knows, adders can multiply using log tables.\footnote{Attribution: \url{https://mathoverflow.net/a/1946}, although
  variations of this joke are widespread and numerous.}

            subject next year (calculus, statistics, physics, chemistry) then you \emph{must} be

  \question When a bank loans money, the interest is \emph{compounded}; that is, you earn interest on the interest you have already
            been charged.
    \begin{parts}
      \item Show that adding $ x\% $ to a debt is equivalent to multiplying the debt by $ (1 + \frac{x}{100}) $.
      \item Suppose interest is calculated after each year (that is to say, it is compounded annually). If the initial
            debt is \$100, and the annual compound interest is 20\%, what is the amount owed by the end of the first three years?
      \item Now, to simplify matters, we will say that our initial loan is \$1, and the interest rate is \$100 per annum. After
            one year, the value of the loan will double to \$2.
        \begin{subparts}
          \subpart If the bank calculates compound interest every six months instead of every year (so our interest is 50\% per
                   six months), show that we owe an extra \$0.25 after one year.
          \subpart If the bank compounds interest every month, show that our total owed is now \$2.6130 after one year.
          \subpart How much will we owe if the bank compounds interest every day?
          \subpart In general, show that if we divide the annual percentage rate by $ n $ and compound it $ n $ times then the end-of-year
                   balance of the loan is $ (1 + \frac{1}{n})^n $.
        \end{subparts}
      \item From your working in part (c) above, we can conclude that as $ n $ increases (that is, if the bank compounds interest with shorter
            and shorter time intervals) then the total owed after one year climbs closer and closer to $ \$2.7182818... $. This number, which
            is fundamental in mathematics, is known as Euler's constant, or $ e $. Show that if a bank compounds interest continuously, with an
            interest rate of $ x\% $ per annum and initial loan $ L $, then after $ t $ years the total owed is
            \begin{displaymath}
              L \times e^{xt/100}.
            \end{displaymath}
