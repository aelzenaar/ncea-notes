We are now going to look at triangles inside circles. Now, last year we learned that any triangles with two equal angles are similar; in particular,
if we take ratios of sides, we obtain the same value. This means that if we have any right-angled triangle with angle $ \theta $ like the one above,
then the ratios $ \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} $, $ \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} $, and $ \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} $
all depend only on the angle $ \theta $; we call them the sine, cosine, and tangent of the angle respectively:
\begin{displaymath}
  \sin \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\qquad \cos \theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \qquad \tan \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}.
\end{displaymath}

In particular, if we draw our triangle inside a unit circle then we can draw the following:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{trigfns}
\end{center}
In fact, we can take this as our definition of $ \sin $ and $ \cos $. To show that $ \tan \theta $ is indeed the line segment marked,
first notice that since the triangle $ OPR $ is right-angled, the angle at the intersection of the horizontal line and the tangent line
is $ \ang{90} - \theta $; so the other non-right-angle in the triangle $ PQR $ is $ \theta $. Hence the hypotenuse of $ PQR $
is $ \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\cos \theta} = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta} $, as proposed.

Note also that, from this diagram, we have
\begin{displaymath}
  \sin^2 \theta + \cos^2  \theta = 1
\end{displaymath}
for every angle $ \theta $.

Since the $ \sin $ of an angle is just the height of the point above the $ x$-axis in the diagram above, we have that $ -1 \leq \sin \theta \leq 1 $;
similarly, $ -1 \leq \cos \theta \leq 1 $. Note that when $ \theta = \ang{90} $, the tangent line becomes horizontal and so never intersects the $ x$-axis:
so $ \tan \ang{90} $ is undefined. We can even graph $ \sin \theta $ (red), $ \cos \theta $ (blue), and $ \tan \theta $ (green):
\begin{center}
  \fbox{\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
      axis lines = center,
      ymax = 1.5, ymin = -1.5,
      xlabel = $ x $,
      ylabel = $ y $
    ]
      \addplot[domain = 0:360, color = red] {sin(x)};
      \addplot[domain = 0:360, color = blue] {cos(x)};
      \addplot[domain = 0:88, color = green] {tan(x)};
      \addplot[domain = 92:268, color = green] {tan(x)};
      \addplot[domain = 272:360, color = green] {tan(x)};
    \end{axis}
  \end{tikzpicture}}
\end{center}

If we graph them in radians, only the labels on the $ x$-axis change:
\begin{center}
  \fbox{\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
      axis lines = center,
      ymax = 1.5, ymin = -1.5,
      xtick={1.5708, 3.14159, 4.7124, 6.28},
      xticklabels={$\frac{\pi}{2}$,$\pi$,$\frac{3\pi}{2}$,$2\pi$},
      xlabel = $ x $,
      ylabel = $ y $
    ]
      \addplot[domain = 0:2*pi, color = red] {sin(deg(x))};
      \addplot[domain = 0:2*pi, color = blue] {cos(deg(x))};
      \addplot[domain = 0:(pi/2-0.01), color = green] {tan(deg(x))};
      \addplot[domain = (pi/2+0.01):(3*pi/2-0.01), color = green] {tan(deg(x))};
      \addplot[domain = (3*pi/2+0.01):2*pi, color = green] {tan(deg(x))};
    \end{axis}
  \end{tikzpicture}}
\end{center}

Let us now begin to look at more general triangles:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{trisines}
\end{center}

\begin{thm}[Sine rule]
  In any triangle, with the angles and sides labelled as above, we have
  \begin{displaymath}
    \frac{\alpha}{\sin a} = \frac{\beta}{\sin b} = \frac{\gamma}{\sin c}.
  \end{displaymath}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  Drop an altitude from $ B $ to $ AC $, creating two new right-angled triangles. Then the length of this line can be calculated using both
  of the resulting right-angled triangles: so $ c \sin \alpha = a \sin \gamma $ and $ \frac{a}{\sin \alpha} = \frac{c}{\sin \gamma} $. This
  proves the theorem.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[Cosine rule]
  In any triangle, with the angles and sides labelled as above, we have
  \begin{displaymath}
    a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc\cos \alpha.
  \end{displaymath}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  Drop an altitude from $ B $ to $ AC $, creating two new right-angled triangles. Then the length $ b $ can be split into two
  lengths, $ c \cos \alpha $ and $ b - c \cos \alpha $; the length of the altitude is $ c \sin \alpha $. Now, apply the Pythagorean
  theorem to the triangle including the angle $ \gamma $:
  \begin{displaymath}
    a^2 = (b - c \cos \alpha)^2 + c^2 \sin^2 \alpha = b^2 - 2bc \cos \alpha + c^2 \cos^2 \alpha + c^2 \sin^2 \alpha = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos \alpha.
  \end{displaymath}
\end{proof}

            vertex, draw the line joining it to the centre of the opposite side. By symmetry, all four such lines
            must meet at a single point. Show, by an exact calculation, that the angle at this point between any
