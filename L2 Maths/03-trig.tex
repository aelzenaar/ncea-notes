We are now going to look at triangles inside circles. Now, last year we learned that any triangles with two equal angles are similar; in particular,
if we take ratios of sides, we obtain the same value. This means that if we have any right-angled triangle with angle $ \theta $ like the one above,
then the ratios $ \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} $, $ \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} $, and $ \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} $
all depend only on the angle $ \theta $; we call them the sine, cosine, and tangent of the angle respectively:
\begin{displaymath}
  \sin \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\qquad \cos \theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \qquad \tan \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}.
\end{displaymath}

In particular, if we draw our triangle inside a unit circle then we can draw the following:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{trigfns}
\end{center}
In fact, we can take this as our definition of $ \sin $ and $ \cos $. To show that $ \tan \theta $ is indeed the line segment marked there,
first notice that since the large triangle is right-angled, the angle at the intersection of the horizontal line and the tangent line
is $ \ang{90} - \theta $; so the other non-right-angle in the smaller triangle is $ \theta $. Hence the hypotenuse of the triangle
is $ \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\cos \theta} = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta} $, as proposed.

Note also that, from this diagram, we have
\begin{displaymath}
  \sin^2 \theta + \cos^2  \theta = 1
\end{displaymath}
for every angle $ \theta $.

Since the $ \sin $ of an angle is just the height of the point above the $ x$-axis in the diagram above, we have that $ -1 \leq \sin \theta \leq 1 $;
similarly, $ -1 \leq \cos \theta \leq 1 $. Note that when $ \theta = \ang{90} $, the tangent line becomes horizontal and so never intersects the $ x$-axis:
so $ \tan \ang{90} $ is undefined. We can even graph $ \sin \theta $ (red), $ \cos \theta $ (blue), and $ \tan \theta $ (green):
\begin{center}
  \fbox{\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
      axis lines = center,
      ymax = 1.5, ymin = -1.5,
      xlabel = $ x $,
      ylabel = $ y $
    ]
      \addplot[domain = 0:360, color = red] {sin(x)};
      \addplot[domain = 0:360, color = blue] {cos(x)};
      \addplot[domain = 0:88, color = green] {tan(x)};
      \addplot[domain = 92:268, color = green] {tan(x)};
      \addplot[domain = 272:360, color = green] {tan(x)};
    \end{axis}
  \end{tikzpicture}}
\end{center}

If we graph them in radians, only the labels on the $ x$-axis change:
\begin{center}
  \fbox{\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
      axis lines = center,
      ymax = 1.5, ymin = -1.5,
      xtick={1.5708, 3.14159, 4.7124, 6.28},
      xticklabels={$\frac{\pi}{2}$,$\pi$,$\frac{3\pi}{2}$,$2\pi$},
      xlabel = $ x $,
      ylabel = $ y $
    ]
      \addplot[domain = 0:2*pi, color = red] {sin(deg(x))};
      \addplot[domain = 0:2*pi, color = blue] {cos(deg(x))};
      \addplot[domain = 0:(pi/2-0.01), color = green] {tan(deg(x))};
      \addplot[domain = (pi/2+0.01):(3*pi/2-0.01), color = green] {tan(deg(x))};
      \addplot[domain = (3*pi/2+0.01):2*pi, color = green] {tan(deg(x))};
    \end{axis}
  \end{tikzpicture}}
\end{center}

Let us now begin to look at more general triangles:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{trisines}
\end{center}

\begin{thm}[Sine rule]
  In any triangle, with the angles and sides labelled as above, we have
  \begin{displaymath}
    \frac{\alpha}{\sin a} = \frac{\beta}{\sin b} = \frac{\gamma}{\sin c}.
  \end{displaymath}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  Drop an altitude from $ B $ to $ AC $, creating two new right-angled triangles. Then the length of this line can be calculated using both
  of the resulting right-angled triangles: so $ c \sin \alpha = a \sin \gamma $ and $ \frac{a}{\sin \alpha} = \frac{c}{\sin \gamma} $. This
  proves the theorem.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[Cosine rule]
  In any triangle, with the angles and sides labelled as above, we have
  \begin{displaymath}
    a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - bc\cos \alpha.
  \end{displaymath}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  Drop an altitude from $ B $ to $ AC $, creating two new right-angled triangles. Then the length $ b $ can be split into two
  lengths, $ c \cos \alpha $ and $ b - c \cos \alpha $; the length of the altitude is $ c \sin \alpha $. Now, apply the Pythagorean
  theorem to the triangle including the angle $ \gamma $:
  \begin{displaymath}
    a^2 = (b - c \cos \alpha)^2 + c^2 \sin^2 \alpha = b^2 - 2bc \cos \alpha + c^2 \cos^2 \alpha + c^2 \sin^2 \alpha = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos \alpha.
  \end{displaymath}
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Questions}
\begin{questions}
  \question A beam of gamma rays is to be used to treat a tumor known to be $ \SI{5.7}{\centi\metre} $ beneath
            the patient's skin. To avoid damaging a vital organ, the radiologist moves the source over by
            $ \SI{8.3}{\centi\metre} $.
    \begin{parts}
      \part At what angle to the patient's skin must the radiologist aim the gamma ray source to hit the tumor?
      \part How far will the beam have to travel through the patient's body before reaching the tumor?
    \end{parts}

  \question A surveyor measures the three sides of a triangular field and finds that they are 117, 165, and 257~metres long.
    \begin{parts}
      \part What is the measure of the largest angle of the field?
      \part What is the area of the field?

  \question A field has the shape of a quadrilateral (four-sided shape) that is \emph{not} a rectangle. Three
            sides measure 2.33, 3.97, and 3.9~kilometres, and two angles measure $ \alpha = \ang{131.06} $
            and $ \gamma = \ang{86.05} $ (as in the figure).

  \question Suppose that the country of Parah has just launched two satellites. The government of Noya sends aloft
            its most reliable astronaut, Ivan Advantage, to observe the satellites.
    \begin{parts}
      \part As Ivan approaches the two satellites, he finds that one of them is $ \SI{8}{\kilo\metre} $ away from him
            and the other is at $ \SI{11}{\kilo\metre} $. He measures the angle between them to be $ \ang{120} $. How
            far apart are the satellites?
      \part Three ships are assigned to rescue Ivan as his spacecraft plunges into the ocean. The ships are at the
            vertices of a triangle with sides of 5, 7, and 10 kilometres.

      \part To welcome their returning hero, the Noyans give Ivan a parade. The parade goes between the three cities
            of Triy, Kwe, and Stin. These cities are at the vertices of an equilateral triangle. The roads connecting them
            are straight, level, and direct, and the parade goes at a constant speed with no stops. From Triy to Kwe
            takes $ \SI{80}{\minute} $ and from Kwe to Stin takes $ \SI{80}{\minute} $, but from Stin back to Triy along
            the third side of the triangle takes one hour and 20 minutes. How do you explain this discrepancy in times?
