\mainHeader{5}{Quadratic Modelling}

A linear function is one of the form
\begin{displaymath}
  f(x) = mx + c;
\end{displaymath}
we have already seen that the graph of such a function is a straight line.

The natural next step is to consider quadratic functions: those of the form
\begin{displaymath}
  f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.
\end{displaymath}
Last year, we saw that the graphs of quadratic functions are parabolae; so we can use quadratic equations to model situations
which are vaguely parabolic.

\begin{ex}\leavevmode
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{dimer}
  \end{center}
  The following table gives the instantaneous rates of reaction for the dimerization reaction above.
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline
      \textbf{Time} (min) & \textbf{Concentration of reactant} (M) & \textbf{Instantaneous reaction rate} (M/min)\\\hline
      0 & 0.0054 &\\\hline
      10 & 0.0044 & \num{8.0e-5}\\\hline
      26 & 0.0034 & \num{5.0e-5}\\\hline
      44 & 0.0027 & \num{3.1e-5}\\\hline
      70 & 0.0020 & \num{1.8e-5}\\\hline
      120 & 0.0014 & \num{8.0e-6}\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  It is known that this reaction is second-order: that is, the reaction rate is modelled by a quadratic function of the
  reaction concentration. Let's call the reaction rate at a particular concentration $ R(C) $; so
  \begin{displaymath}
    R(C) = XC^2 + YC + Z.
  \end{displaymath}
  By using the values in the table above, we have that
  \begin{align*}
    \num{8.0e-5} &= X \cdot (0.0044)^2 + Y (0.0044) + Z\\
    \num{5.0e-5} &= X \cdot (0.0034)^2 + Y (0.0034) + Z\\
    \num{3.1e-5} &= X \cdot (0.0027)^2 + Y (0.0027) + Z.
  \end{align*}

  Using \texttt{matlab} to find $ X $, $ Y $, and $ Z $ we have
  \begin{verbatim}
    >> syms X Y Z;
    >> eqn1 = 8.0e-5 == X * (0.0044)^2 + Y * (0.0044) + Z;
    >> eqn2 = 5.0e-5 == X * (0.0034)^2 + Y * (0.0034) + Z;
    >> eqn3 = 3.1e-5 == X * (0.0027)^2 + Y * (0.0027) + Z;
    >> [A,B] = equationsToMatrix([eqn1,eqn2,eqn3],[X,Y,Z]);
    >> linsolve(A,B);

    ans =

                                      6148914691236521356/3658604241285734375
        364782697339246960843864593812277/21596587553915600330621553957928960

  \end{verbatim}
  So our model is
  \begin{displaymath}
    R(C) \approx 1.6807 C^2 + 0.01689 C - \num{2.686e-5}.
  \end{displaymath}
  Graphing our model (blue) next to the original data (red), we see that the match is reasonable.
  \begin{center}
  \fbox{\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
      /pgf/number format/1000 sep={},
      axis lines = center,
      xlabel = $ C $,
      ylabel = $ R(C) $
    ]
      \addplot[domain = 0.001:0.005, color = blue, samples = 100] {1.6807*x^2 + 0.01689*x - 2.686e-5};
      \addplot[color = red, mark = square] coordinates{(0.0044,8e-5)(0.0034,5e-5)(0.0027,3.1e-5)(0.0020,1.8e-5)(0.0014,8e-6)};
    \end{axis}
  \end{tikzpicture}}
  \end{center}
  This is useful because it allows us to predict the reaction rate for concentrations that we have not measured; alternatively, we can predict the
  reactant concentration given the reaction rate (which can be easily measured).
\end{ex}

Some situations require us to find a minimum or a maximum value. Suppose, for example, that we are asked the following.

\begin{ex}
  Find the dimensions of a rectangle with perimeter \SI{1000}{\metre} such that the area is maximised.

  \textit{Solution.} Later this year, we will learn a systematic way to solve optimisation problems like this. However, using calculus here would be
  like using a machine gun to kill a fly (although for some reason it is the favoured method of economics students)!

  Let us call the two side lengths $ x $ and $ y $; so we have that $ 1000 = 2x + 2y $ (so $ 500 = x + y $), and we want to minimise $ A = xy $. Substituting,
  we have $ A = x(500 - x) = 500x - x^2 $. The maximum value will be the vertex of this parabola, so we need to put this formula into
  the form $ A = -(x - b)^2 + c $; if we expand this, then $ A = -x^2 + 2xb - b^2 + c $ and so we want $ 2b = 500 $ and $ c - b^2 = 0 $.
  From these, we see that $ b = 250 $ and $ c = (250)^2 $. Hence $ A = -(x - 250)^2 + (250)^2 $; the vertex is at $ x = 250 $, and so $ y = 250 $: the area
  will be maximised when the rectangle is a square.
\end{ex}
