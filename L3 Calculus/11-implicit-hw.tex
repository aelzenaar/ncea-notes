\mainHeaderDiffHw{11}{Implicit Differentiation}
\subsection*{Reading}
Underpinning all our work this week was the idea that if an implicit formula in $ x $ and $ y $ is `nice enough' then there is a way to
find a `function' from $ x $ to $ y $ that we can differentiate. This rather vague notion is formalised by the rather important \emph{implicit
function theorem}, which states that if an equation $ F(x,y) = 0 $ has solution $ (x,y) = (a,b) $ then, under certain conditions\footnote{~Essentially,
that the graph of the function is not `vertical' at $ (a,b) $.}, the equation implicitly defines in some region around $ x $ a function with
a continuous derivative that takes the value $ b $ at $ x = a $ --- in other words, there is some function whose graph is the graph of $ F(x,y) = 0 $
for all of the points around the point $ (a,b) $ that we care about.

The proof of the theorem is long and we won't attempt it here; the important thing to take away is that this notion of taking a graph and then
looking at the function which it describes in a small region is well-defined, and well-defined in such a way that we can do calculus on it.
