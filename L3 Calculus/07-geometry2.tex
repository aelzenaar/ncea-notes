\mainHeaderDiff{7}{Higher Derivatives and the Geometry of a Function}
Back in the homework on limits, I gave you the following definitions:
\subsubsection*{Properties of Functions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A function is \textbf{increasing} if its derivative is positive.
  \item A function is \textbf{decreasing} if its derivative is negative.
  \item A function is \textbf{concave down} if its derivative is decreasing.
  \item A function is \textbf{concave up} if its derivative is increasing.
  \item A function $ f $ is \textbf{continuous} at a point $ a $ if $ \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a) $.
\end{itemize}

\begin{ex}
  The function $ x \mapsto x^2 $ is concave up everywhere.
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
  The function $ x \mapsto \sin x $ is concave down when $ (2n)\pi < x < (2n + 1)\pi $, and concave up when $ (2n + 1)\pi < x < (2n + 2)\pi $
  (for all integers $ n $). Draw a diagram to see this.
\end{ex}

We can tell if a function is increasing (getting larger) or decreasing (getting smaller) around a point by looking at the derivative
at that point. However, in order to look for concavity we must look at the derivative of the derivative (the second derivative). If
a function is concave up (curving up), the second derivative is positive; if a function is concave down at a point, then the second
derivative is negative.

A point where a function changes from concave up to concave down (or vice versa) is known as an \textbf{inflection point}.
\begin{ex}
  The function $ x \mapsto x^3 $ has an inflection point at $ (0,0) $; to the left of this point, the function is concave
  down (the second derivative is negative) and to the right the function is concave up (the second derivative is positive).
\end{ex}

We call the value of the first derivative the \textit{slope} or \textit{gradient} of the function at a point; similarly,
the second derivative measures how "curvy" a function is and we call its value the \textit{concavity} of a function
at a point.

Unfortunately, there is no nice method for checking for continuity involving the derivatives, beyond the fact (proved in the exercises)
that if a function is differentiable at a point then it is continuous there. At this level, however, it should be fairly obvious at which
points a function is discontinuous.

\begin{ex}
  \textit{Question.} Consider the function defined by $ f(x) = x^4 - 2x^2 + 3 $. (a) Find the intervals on which $ f $
  is increasing or decreasing. (b) Find the intervals of concavity and the inflection points.

  \textit{Solution.} We have $ f'(x) = 4x^3 - 4x $. This function is zero at $ x \in \{-1, 0, 1\} $, and so (since the function
  is a positive cubic) $ f $ will be decreasing when $ x < -1 $, increasing when $ -1 < x < 0 $, decreasing when $ 0 < x < 1 $,
  and increasing when $ 1 < x $. We also have $ f''(x) = 12x^2 - 4 $ and so $ f''(x) = 0 $ when $ x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} $.
  Hence the function is concave up when $ x < -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} $, concave down when $ \abs{x} < \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} $, and concave
  up when $ x > \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} $. The inflection points will be $ x = \pm{1}{\sqrt{3}} $.

      ]
        \addplot[domain=-2:2, color=red, samples=200] {x^4 - 2*x^2 + 3};

  \questioS We will prove that differentiability of $ f $ at $ a $ implies continuity of $ f $ at $ a $; expand the following
            and use the limit laws to show that $ \lim_{x \to a} f(x) - f(a) = 0 $, carefully indicating where you use the existence
            of the derivative.
            \begin{displaymath}
              \left[\lim_{a \to x} f(x) - f(a)\right]\left[\lim_{a \to x} \frac{x - a}{x - a}\right]

  \questioS Scholarship 2010: Recall that the points of inflection of a curve are places where the second derivative
            changes sign. These are typically, \textbf{but not always}, points at which the second derivative is zero.

            Consider the curve $ y = \sqrt[3]{x} e^{-x^2} $.

            Write the second derivative in the form $ \od[2]{y}{x} = (ax^4 + bx^2 + x)e^{-x^2} x^{-5/3} $, and hence
            find the $ x$-ordinates of the points of inflection of the curve.
  \questioS Scholarship 2004: (You may wish to remind yourself how to perform long division of polynomials.) Consider the function
            \begin{displaymath}
              y = \frac{x^2}{1 + x^2},
            \end{displaymath}
            where $ -1 \leq x \leq 1 $. The gradient at the point $ x = 1 $ is $ \frac{1}{2} $.

            Hence show that there is a point with $ \frac{1}{4} \leq x \leq \frac{1}{2} $ where the gradient is also $ \frac{1}{2} $.
