\mainHeaderIntg{24}{Kinematics}
Calculus was independently developed by Sir Isaac Newton to describe mechanical motion in physics. This use is known as \textit{kinematics} (from
the Greek \textit{kinein}, `to move'). Suppose a particle moves from position $ x_0 $ to position $ x_1 $ over a time $ \Delta t $. We call the ratio
\begin{displaymath}
  \frac{x_1 - x_0}{\Delta t}
\end{displaymath}
the \textit{average velocity} of the particle; if we let $ x_1 \to x_2 $ (or let $ t \to 0 $), we obtain the derivative $ \od{x}{t} = v $, the
\textit{instantaneous velocity} of the particle at the point $ x $ (usually just abbreviated to velocity).

Similarly, the rate of change of velocity is called \textit{acceleration}. We have $ a = \od{v}{t} = \od[2]{x}{t} $. (Out of interest, the third
derivative of displacement is known as \textit{jerk}, and the fourth is \textit{jounce}.)

Now, suppose we know the velocity of a particle at each instant over a given time interval. Suppose we split the interval up into small intervals,
each of length $ \Delta t $. Then the total distance travelled is approximated by $ \sum v \Delta t $, where the sum is taken for each small interval.
If we make the intervals smaller, then clearly our approximation becomes better; and to obtain the true answer, we need only take an integral.

\begin{center}
  \def\arraystretch{1.5}
  \begin{tabular}{|rcc|}\hline
    \textbf{Displacement}, $ s $ && $\rint_{t_0}^{t_1} v \dif{t} $\\
    \textbf{Velocity}, $ v $ & $ \od{s}{t} $ & $ \rint_{t_0}^{t_1} a \dif{t} $\\
    \textbf{Acceleration}, $ a $ & $ \od{v}{t} $ &\\\hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

We can prove the following \textit{kinematic equations} if acceleration is kept constant over a time period $ \Delta t $. These equations
should be familar to all of those that took level 2 physics, and they are derived by finding areas underneath a velocity-time graph: in
short, via calculus.

\begin{align*}
  v_f &= v_i + a \Delta t\\
  s &= v_i \Delta t + \frac{1}{2} a {\Delta t}^2\\
  v_f^2 &= v_i^2 + 2a s\\
  s &= \frac{v_f + v_i}{2} \Delta t
\end{align*}
