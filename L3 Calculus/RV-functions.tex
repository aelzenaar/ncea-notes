\subsection* {What is Calculus?}
Calculus is the study of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Continuous change.
  \item Slope, area, and volume.
  \item Functions and relationships.
\end{itemize}

It has applications in:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Physics and chemistry.
  \item Probability theory.
  \item Population theory.
  \item Economics (I am assured).
\end{itemize}

In pure mathematics, calculus can be seen as the computational side of a pretty
subject called \textbf{real analysis}.

\subsection*{Revision of Functions}
Arguably, the most fundamental concept in calculus is that of a \textit{function}.

\begin{defn}[Function]
  A function is a something which takes a set of things (for example, the real numbers $ \mathbb{R} $) and assigns
  to each one exactly one thing (which could be the same or different).
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
  The map which takes a number $ x $ and spits out $ x^2 $ is a function --- for every input, there is exactly one output. If
  we \textit{graph} this function, we plot its input on the $ x-$axis and its output on the $ y-$axis and obtain a parabola.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  The curve graphed below is \textit{not} a function, since for some inputs (like 1) it has more than one output. We can check this
  by drawing vertical lines along the function, like that pictured: if a graph is a function, no vertical line can ever cross the curve
  more than once (this is the \textit{vertical-line test}).

  \end{center}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  The map $ f : x \mapsto \sin x $ is a function. We could also define it by `the function $ f $ such that $ f(x) = \sin x $'.
  This function $ f $ can only produce numbers between $1$ and $-1$; we say that its \textit{range} is the interval from $ -1 $ to 1.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  The map $ \iota : x \mapsto x $ is a function, called the \textit{identity function}.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  The map $ \ln x $ is a function, but it is only defined when $ x > 0 $: we say that its \textit{domain} is the positive real numbers.
\end{ex}
