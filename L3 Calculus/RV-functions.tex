\section*{NCEA Level 3 Calculus\\Revision: Functions}
Before we look at calculus proper, we need to revise a few things from our previous studies. Arguably, the most fundamental
concept from L2 is that of a function, together with its graph.

\begin{defn}[Function]
  A \textbf{function} is a relationship between two sets of things, called the \textit{range} and the \textit{domain}, such that
  everything in the range is related to exactly one thing in the domain. If $ f $ is a function which maps the value $ x $
  to the value $ y $, we write $ f : x \mapsto y $, or $ f(x) = y $. If $ f $ has range $ X $ and domain $ Y $, we write $ f : X \to Y $.

  Two functions $ f $ and $ g $ are called equal \emph{if and only if} the ranges of the two functions are the same \emph{and} for every $ x $ in that
  range, $ f(x) = g(x) $.
\end{defn}
You can think of a function as a rule: it could be given by a formula, or by a list of inputs and outputs, or in any other way that one wants.

\begin{defn}[Graph]
  If $ f $ is a function, then the set of all points $ (x,y) $ such that $ y = f(x) $ is called the \textbf{graph} of the function.
\end{defn}

\begin{exs}\leavevmode
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The map which takes a number $ x $ and spits out $ x^2 $ is a function --- for every input, there is exactly one output. If
          we plot every point in the graph of this function, by plotting each input on the $ x-$axis and the corresponding output on
          the $ y-$axis, we obtain a parabola.
    \item The curve graphed below is \textit{not} the graph of a function, since for some inputs (like 1) the map has more than one output. We can check this
          by drawing vertical lines along the function, like that pictured: if a graph is a function, no vertical line can ever cross the curve
          more than once (this is the \textit{vertical-line test}).
          \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{linetest}
          \end{center}
    \item The map $ f : x \mapsto \sin x $ is a function (and so are all the other triangle ratios). We could also define it by `the
          function $ f $ such that $ f(x) = \sin x $'. This function $ f $ can only produce numbers between $1$ and $-1$; we say that
          its range is the interval from $ -1 $ to 1.
    \item On the other hand, to ensure that we obtain functions the inverse trigonometric maps must be restricted to certain inputs: to
          take a particular example, since there are infinitely many $ x $ so that $ \sin x = 1 $, there are infinitely many possibilities
          for the value of $ \arcsin x $. We will refrain from picking an explicit range for the inverse functions here and will generally
          just pick the most convenient at the time: it should be reasonably obvious from context.
    \item The map $ \iota : x \mapsto x $ is a function, called the \textit{identity function}.
    \item The map $ \ln x $ is a function, but it is only defined when $ x > 0 $: we say that its \textit{domain} is the positive real numbers.
    \item The following are some more non-examples of functions.
