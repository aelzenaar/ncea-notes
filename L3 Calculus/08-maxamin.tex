Recall from Level 2 that a \textit{local maximum} of a function $ f $ is some point $ (x, f(x)) $
such that, for a sufficiently small interval $ I $ around $ x $, for all $ y \in I $ $ f(y) \leq f(x) $;
a \textit{local minimum} is defined in a similar way (see exercises).

\begin{ex}
  The function $ x \mapsto x^2 $ has a local minimum at $ (0, 0) $.
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
  The function $ x \mapsto 2x^3 + 15x^2 + 36x + 2 $ has a local maximum at $ (-3, -25) $ and a local minimum at $ (-2, -26) $.
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
  The function $ x \mapsto \sin x $ has a local maximum at $ (2n\pi + \frac{\pi}{2}, 1) $ for every $ n \in \mathbb{Z} $, and
  a local minimum at $ (2n\pi - \frac{\pi}{2}, 1) $ for every $ n \in \mathbb{Z} $.
\end{ex}

Local extrema are also sometimes called \textit{relative extrema}.

It is possible to prove that if $ f $ is defined around some value $ x $, if $ f $ has a relative extremum at $ (x, f(x)) $, and
if $ f' $ is defined at $ x $, then $ f'(x) = 0 $ (Theorem 1.10 in the notes). Because of this, we define a \textit{critical point}
of a function $ f $ to be some value $ x $ such that either $ f'(x) = 0 $, or $ f'(x) $ is undefined. In the first case, we also
call the value a \textit{stationary point}.

\textbf{All local extrema occur at critical points, but not all critical points occur at extrema.}

\begin{ex}
  The function $ x \mapsto 2x^3 + 15x^2 + 36x + 2 $ above has critical points $ x = -2 $ and $ x = -3 $. Both of
  these are local extrema.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  The function $ x \mapsto x^3 $ above has a critical point at $ x = 0 $, but does not have a local extrema there.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  The function $ x \mapsto \frac{1}{x} $ \textit{does not} have a critical point at $ x = 0 $, \textbf{because it is not defined there}.
\end{ex}

We can use the first derivative to classify extrema as either maxima or minima.
\subsubsection*{The First Derivative Test}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Determine all critical points of $ f $.
  \item Determine the sign of $ f'(x) $ to the left and right of each critical point $ x_0 $:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If $ f'(x) $ changes from positive to negative as we move from left to right across $ x_0 $, then $ f(x) $ has a local maximum at $ x_0 $.
      \item If $ f'(x) $ changes from negative to positive as we move from left to right across $ x_0 $, then $ f(x) $ has a local minimum at $ x_0 $.
      \item If $ f'(x) $ does not change sign across $ x_0 $, then $ f(x) $ does not have a relative extremum at $ x_0 $ (e.g. $ y = x^3 $).
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Recall last week's material; using the second derivative, we can come up with a second test:
\subsubsection*{The Second Derivative Test}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Compute $ f'(x) $ and $ f''(x) $.
  \item Find all the stationary points of $ f $ by finding all the points $ x_0 $ such that $ f'(x_0) = 0 $.
  \item Determine the sign of $ f''(x) $ for each stationary point $ x_0 $:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If $ f''(x_0) < 0 $, then $ f(x) $ has a relative maximum at $ x_0 $.
      \item If $ f''(x_0) > 0 $, then $ f(x) $ has a relative minimum at $ x_0 $.
      \item If $ f''(x_0) = 0 $, then $ f(x) $ could have a relative maximum, a relative minimum, or neither.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{ex}
  Find and classify the critical points of $ y = x^3 - 3x^2 + 6 $.

  \textit{Solution.} We have $ \od{y}{x} = 3x^2 - 6x $ and $ \od[2]{y}{x} = 6x - 6 $. Hence
                     the critical points are $ x = 0 $ and $ x = 2 $. At the former point, $ \od[2]{y}{x} < 0 $,
                     and so the point is a maximum; at the latter point, $ \od[2]{y}{x} > 0 $ and so the point is
                     a minimum.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  Find two numbers whose difference is 100 and whose product is a minimum.

  \textit{Solution.} Let the two numbers be $ x $ and $ x + 100 $. We wish to minimise $ y = x(x + 100) $;
  clearly $ y' = 2x + 100 $, and so $ x = 50 $ is a critical point. To the left of $ x = 50 $, the derivative
  is negative; to the right, the derivative is positive. Hence $ x = 50 $ is indeed a minimum. The two required
  numbers are therefore 50 and 150.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  Find and classify the critical points of $ y = (x - 1)^2 + \ln x $.

  \textit{Solution.} The derivative is $ y' = 2x - 2 + \frac{1}{x} $. We therefore have one critical
  point at $ x = 0 $ (where $ y' $ is undefined); this is an asymptote.
  Setting $ y' = 0 $, we have $ 0 = 2x - 2 + \frac{1}{x} = 2x^2 - 2x + 1 $ which has no real roots. Hence $ x = 0 $ is
  the only critical point, and the curve has no local extrema.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  A rectangular plot of land is to be fenced using two varieties of fence. Two opposite sides will
  use fences selling for \$3 per metre, while the other two sides will use cheaper fence selling for \$2 per metre.
  Given that the total budget is \$1200, what is the greatest area of land which can be fenced?

  \textit{Solution.} Let $ x $ be the length of one of the expensive sides; then the length of one of the cheaper
                    sides is $ \frac{1}{2}(1200 - 3x) $, and the total area is $ A = \frac{1}{2} x (1200 - 3x) = \frac{1}{2}(1200x - 3x^2) $.
                    Hence $ \od{A}{x} = 600 - 3x $. We wish to find the maximum area, so set $ \od{A}{x} = 0 $; hence $ 3x = 600 $ and $ x = 200 $.
                    Note that the second derivative is always negative, so this stationary point must be a maximum as required. The length
                    of the other side will be $ \frac{1}{2}(1200 - 600) = 300 $, and so the maximum area is $ 300 \times 200 = 60000 $ square metres.
\end{ex}
