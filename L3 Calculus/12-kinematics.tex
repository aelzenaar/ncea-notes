\mainHeaderDiff{12}{Kinematics}
\textcolor{orange}{\textbf{This is an easy week, especially if you are doing physics (or did level 2 physics). Take a well-earned break!}}
Calculus was independently developed by Sir Isaac Newton to describe motion in physics. This use is known as \textit{kinematics} (from the
Greek \textit{kinein}, `to move'). Suppose a particle moves from position $ x_0 $ to position $ x_1 $ over a time $ \Delta t $. We call the
ratio
\begin{displaymath}
  \frac{x_1 - x_0}{\Delta t}
\end{displaymath}
the \textit{average velocity} of the particle; if we let $ x_1 \to x_2 $, we obtain the derivative $ \od{x}{t} = v $, the \textit{instantaneous
velocity} of the particle at the point $ x $ (usually just abbreviated to velocity).

Similarly, the rate of change of velocity is called \textit{acceleration}. We have $ a = \od{v}{t} $.

If we draw a velocity-time graph, like that above, the area under the graph gives us the distance travelled by the object
during a time interval; this means that in some sense finding area is inverse to finding slope. Intuitively, this is a bit
weird --- the way to think about it is that if we increase the area under the velocity curve by a little bit, then the distance
we move in that time also increases proportionally. On the other hand, if we move a certain distance then we increase the area
under the velocity curve because we have a non-zero velocity.

Algebraically, we have $ \text{rate} = \frac{\text{change in quantity}}{\text{time}} $ and so $ \text{change in quantity} = \text{rate} \times \text{time} $.

We will explore this idea in more detail in a couple of weeks when we start talking about \textit{integration}.

We can derive the following \textit{kinematic equations} if acceleration is kept constant over a time period $ t $:
\begin{align*}
  v_f &= v_i + a \Delta t\\
  \Delta x &= v_i \Delta t + \frac{1}{2} a {\Delta t}^2\\
  v_f^2 &= v_i^2 + 2a \Delta x\\
  \Delta x &= \frac{v_f + v_i}{2} \Delta t
\end{align*}

These can all be found from the definitions of acceleration and velocity, and by taking areas and slopes of graphs (if
we remember that the velocity graph must be made up of straight lines since the acceleration is constant). The equations
are not examinable in the L3 calculus exam. We mainly look at them for context.

\subsection*{Questions}
All distances are given in \si{\metre}, and all times in \si{\second}, unless otherwise stated.
\begin{questions}
  \questioA Describe the relationship between velocity and displacement.
  \questioA A particle moves from $ x = \SI{2}{\metre} $ to $ x = \SI{3}{\metre} $ over a time \SI{3}{\second}. What is its average velocity over that time?
  \questioA A particle moves from $ (3,4) $ to $ (12,-3) $ over a time \SI{10}{\second}. If the displacements are measured in metres, what is the magnitude of
            its average velocity during that period?
  \questioA An object $ A $ has a positive acceleration $ a $, and a second object $ B $ has a negative acceleration $ -a $. Both are moving in the
            same direction. Which of the following is \textbf{not} true?
    \begin{parts}
      \part Object $ B $ is slowing down compared to object $ A $.
      \part Object $ B $ has a lower velocity than object $ A $.
      \part At some point, object $ B $ will reach a velocity of zero and then start moving in the opposite direction.
      \part If object $ B $ is behind object $ A $, the two will never cross paths.
    \end{parts}
  \questioA Suppose a particle has a velocity of $ \SI{34}{\metre\per\second} $. How long does it take for the particle to travel \SI{150}{\metre}?
  \question The velocity $ v $ of an object $ t $ seconds after it moves from the origin is given by
            \begin{displaymath}
              v(t) = 3t^2 - 6t - 24.

            above the ground. The constant acceleration due to gravity is \SI{-9.81}{\metre\per\second\squared}. Air resistance
            is negligible.

  \questioA A racing car travelling at \SI{210}{\kilo\metre\per\hour} skids for a distance of \SI{150}{\metre}
            after its brakes are applied. The brakes provide a constant deceleration.
