All distances are given in \si{\metre}, and all times in \si{\second}, unless otherwise stated.
\begin{questions}
  \question A distress flare is fired vertically into the air from a boat at sea. The height in metres of the flare $ t $ seconds
            after firing is given by
            \begin{displaymath}
              h = 122.5t - 4.9t^2.
            \end{displaymath}
    \begin{parts}
      \part What is the initial velocity of the flare?
      \part At the peak of its flight, what is the vertical velocity of the flare?
      \part What is the maximum height reached by the flare?
    \end{parts}
  \question Part of the course for an ocean swim runs from bouy $ A $ to bouy $ B $. Swimmers must come ashore
            on the at some point $ P $ along a long straight beach on the way. Bouy $ A $ is \SI{800}{\metre} away
            from the beach, and bouy $ B $ is \SI{600}{\metre} away from the beach. What is the least distance that
            a swimmer must swim? (Hint: minimise $ PA + PB $.)
