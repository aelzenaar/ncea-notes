\mainHeaderDiff{1}{The Derivative}

What is the derivative?
\begin{itemize}
  \item A way to find the slope of another function.
  \item A function giving a rate of change.
  \item A way to find maxima and minima of a function.
\end{itemize}
Essentially, the value of the derivative of a function at a point is the gradient/slope/rate of change of that function at that point.

\begin{ex}
  Consider a function defined by $ y = 2x + 1 $. At every point, the slope of the graph of this function is 2; so
  the value of the derivative of this function is 2 at every point.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  The speed of a particle at any time is the rate of change of the displacement of the particle at that time;
  this can also be viewed as the slope of the displacement-time graph of the particle. Hence the speed of the
  particle is the derivative of the displacement.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  In the diagram, the derivative of the red functions is shown as the blue function. Note
  that the derivative of the function depends only upon the shape, not the $ y$-shift. Also,
  see that the derivative is positive as the function increases and is negative when the
  function is decreasing. The derivative is zero exactly where the function is `flat'.

  \questioA Consider each of these functions in turn. Where is the derivative of each (i) negative, (ii) positive, (iii) zero, and (iv) undefined?
    \begin{parts}
      \part $ x \mapsto x^2 $
      \part $ x \mapsto \sin x $
      \part $ x \mapsto \tan x $
    \end{parts}
  \questioA Describe the derivative of the function $ x \mapsto \tan^{-1} x $.
  \questioM Consider the function $ f : t \mapsto \mathrm{floor}(t) $. Where is $ f $ differentiable? (Define $ \mathrm{floor}(t) $ to be the greatest integer
            less than or equal to $ t $.)
  \questioM When a hot water tap is turned on, the temperature $ T $ of the water depends on how long
            the water has been running.
    \begin{parts}
      \part Sketch a possible graph of $ T $ as a function of the time $ t $ that the tap has been running.
      \part Describe how the rate of change of $ T $ w.r.t. $ t $ varies as $ t $ increases.
      \part Sketch a graph of the derivative of $ T $ w.r.t. $ t $.
    \end{parts}
  \questioM The rate of change of a population at a time $ t $ is directly proportional to the
            population $ P(t) $ at that time, such that $ \od{P}{t} = P $. Draw a graph of the
            population over time if $ P(0) \approx 1000 $.
  \questioM Consider a continuous function $ f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} $ which has $ n $ roots
            (all of multiplicity one) in some interval $ I $. How many roots must its derivative have
            in $ I $?
  \questioM If a function is periodic, with a period of $ T $, what can you say about its derivative?
  \questioM Consider an ellipse, $ \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 $. This is not a function: since both $ (0, b) $ and $ (0, -b) $ are
            members of the function, it fails the vertical line test. However, it would be nice to reason about its
            rate of change \textit{as if it were} a function. Describe the slope of the ellipse as a particle traces the curve in
            an anticlockwise direction at a constant rate.
  \questioM The number of bacteria after $ t $ hours in a controlled laboratory experiment is $ n = f(t) $.

      \part Suppose that there is an unlimited amount of space and nutrients. Which would you
            expect to be larger, $ f'(5) $ or $ f'(10) $? If the supply of nutrients is limited
            does your answer change?
