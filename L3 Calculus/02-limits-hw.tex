\subsection*{Reading}
Derivatives and limits allow us to classify functions and their behaviour. Consider the following:

\subsubsection*{Properties of Functions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A function is \textbf{increasing} if its derivative is positive.
  \item A function is \textbf{decreasing} if its derivative is negative.
  \item A function is \textbf{concave down} if its derivative is decreasing.
  \item A function is \textbf{concave up} if its derivative is increasing.
  \item A function $ f $ is \textbf{continuous} at a point $ a $ if $ \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a) $.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Questions}
\begin{questions}

  \question On an axis, sketch a graph of some function $ f $ that has the following features:
            \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
              \item Is continuous for $ 0 < x < 5 $ and $ 5 < x < 9 $ and is discontinuous when $ x = 5 $
              \item Is concave down ($f''(x) < 0 $) for $ 0 < x < 5 $
              \item Has $ f'(x) = 0 $ at $ (3, 8) $
              \item Has $ \lim_{x \to 5} f(x) = 6 $.
              \item Is not differentiable at $ (7, 3) $.
