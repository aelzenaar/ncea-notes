\section{Introduction}
What does it really mean to \emph{solve} an equation? These notes attempt
to briefly present an outline to Level 3 and Scholarship methods for both finding
solutions to equations and interpreting those solutions.

We will begin with simple linear equations, and will work our way up to arbitrary
polynomials. Geometric and algebraic interpretations will be presented, along with
a number of examples and exercises.

Philosophically, we have made the decision to leave a number of important results
(chiefly de~Moirve's~Theorem) as exercises. However, these results are required
knowledge for the later problems --- so the reader should at least glance at previous
problems before attempting later ones.

Some exercises are much more difficult than others, and the difficulty does not
always increase within a section (i.e. sometimes the first exercises can be quite
hard). The number of stars by each problem is roughly indicative of a mixture of
difficulty and time required. There is, however, no guarantee that the author's
idea of a difficult question will match up with the reader's idea of a difficult
question!

Note that there are fully worked answers for all problems, and often these solutions
contain insights or additional information not in the main text. They are designed to
be read in conjunction with the problems (but have a go yourself before reading the
solutions). Additional information on the problems themselves, as well as a discussion
of some notation, can be found in the introduction to the solutions.

The culmination of the text comes in sections 6 and 8; the former is a digression
into more pure mathematics (developing a theory of the roots of unity), and the latter
is a more applied section (developing the solution of the general cubic). Both should
be easily within reach of the enthusiastic student.

\section{Linear Equations}

The following quote is known as \emph{Diophantus' Riddle}.

\begin{quote}
  God gave him his boyhood one-sixth of his life,\\
  One twelfth more as youth while whiskers grew rife;\\
  And then yet one-seventh ere marriage begun;\\
  In five years there came a bouncing new son.\\
  Alas, the dear child of master and sage\\
  After attaining half the measure of his father's life chill fate took him.\\
  After consoling his fate by the science of numbers for four years,\\
  He ended his life.
\end{quote}

The poem describes the length of life of the Greek mathematician and philosopher
Diophantus, and can be expressed symbolically as:
\begin{displaymath}
  \label{eqn:diophantus}
  D = \frac{1}{6}D + \frac{1}{12}D + \frac{1}{7}D + 5 + \frac{1}{2}D + 4
\end{displaymath}
In order to find Diophantus' age, we must find some number $ D $ such that both
sides of the equals sign are equal. It should be an easy exercise for the reader
to rearrange the equation to obtain $ D = 84 $.

The equation above is known as a linear equation. A linear equation
always has at most one \emph{solution} --- a value which can be substituted in for
the unknown to make both sides of the equation equal.

All linear equations can be put into the standard form $ ax + b = 0 $ for some $ a $ and
$ b $. In general, to solve any linear equation we can rearrange it into this form
and then take $ x = -\frac{b}{a} $.

It is trivial, then, to solve linear equations algebraically. However, it is often useful to be
able to visualise the solutions to equations. Take the equation $ 3x - 2(x+4) = 3(x+6) $
for example --- it is difficult to see at a glance what the solution is without first
rearranging it into the form $ ax + b = 0 $. One method that we can use is to subtract the
right-hand side from the left-hand side, replace the resulting zero  with $ y $, and graph it.

\begin{align*}
                      3x - 2(x + 4) &= 3(x + 6) \\
  \implies 3x - 2(x + 4) - 3(x + 6) &= 0        &&\text{(rearranging to make the RHS zero)}\\
           3x - 2(x + 4) - 3(x + 6) &= y        &&\text{(substituting $ y $ for the RHS)}
\end{align*}

After graphing this equation, we can look at the $ x $ value where $ y = 0 $ --- this will
be our solution.

\begin{center}\fbox{
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
    xlabel=$x$,
    ylabel={$y$},
    axis lines=middle,
    scale=.8
  ]
    \addplot[domain=-20:10, color=CornflowerBlue]{ 3*x - 2*(x + 4) - 3*(x + 6) };
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
}\\
\textit{The graph of $ y = 3x - 2(x + 4) - 3(x + 6) $.}
\end{center}

From the graph we can see that when $ x = -11 $, the function passes through the $ x$-axis --- and so $ x = -11 $ is
the solution to our linear equation.

This is an important thing to note --- for equations, we can graph the function, and
the solutions will be the places where it cuts the $ x$-axis (i.e. where it becomes
zero). Because of this, we often call the solutions of an equation the \emph{zeroes}
of an equation, or the \emph{roots} (because they are the places where the function
grows from). In general, if we have some function $ f $ then we can talk about the
roots or zeros of $ f $, and the solutions of $ f(x) = 0 $.

Equations like $ 4x-3x = x+1 $ do not touch the $x$-axis. These equations have no
solutions since they are not satisfied by \emph{any} value of $ x $.

\subsection*{Exercises}

\section{Quadratic Equations}

\end{figure*}
Several ancient clay tablets from the Old Babylonian period (1800 - 1600 BC)
contain mathematical problems and solutions. Such a problem, given on the tablet
illustrated, is (translated of course):

\begin{quote}
  I have added up seven times the side of my square and eleven times the area,
  getting 6;15.
\end{quote}

The number 6;15 is in sexagesimal notation; it means $ 6 + \frac{15}{60} = 6.25 $. We
can therefore rewrite this problem as follows, where $ x $ is the length of the side
of the square and $ x^2 $ is the area:
\begin{displaymath}
  11x^2 + 7x = 6.25
\end{displaymath}
We can use a similar graphical approach to that above as we are simply
finding the zeros of $ 11x^2 + 7x - 6.25 = y $.

\begin{center}\fbox{
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
    xlabel=$x$,
    ylabel=$y$,
    axis lines=middle
  ]
    \addplot[domain=-1:1, samples=100, color=purple]{11*x^2 + 7*x - 6.25};
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
}\\
\textit{The graph of $ y = 11x^2 + 7x - 6.25 $}.
\end{center}

We find that the only positive solution to the equation is $ x = 0.5 $ --- or 0;30 in
Babylonian notation.

This problem is an example of a quadratic equation --- an equation where the highest
power of $ x $ is 2. All quadratic equations can be put into the form $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $,
where $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $ are constants.

\subsection*{The Quadratic Formula}
In fact, there is a general formula to solve \emph{any} quadratic equation. The
following proof of this illustrates the idea of \emph{completing the square}, which
is a way to reduce solving a general quadratic equation (a hard problem) to a simpler
problem: that of solving $ x^2 = m $ for $ x $ given a value for $ m $. A second
proof is given as an exercise at the end of the section.

\begin{thm}[Quadratic Formula]
  A quadratic equation $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $ (where $ a \neq 0 $) has at most
  two solutions, which are given by
  \begin{equation}
    x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
  \end{equation}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  We first simplify the equation by dividing through by $ a $, obtaining
  that $ x^2 + \frac{b}{a} x + \frac{c}{a} = 0 $.

  The next step is to rearrange the formula to obtain an equation of the form $ (x + p)^2 = q $.
  This can be done by noting that $ (x + p)^2 - q = x^2 + 2px + p^2 - q $; matching coefficients,
  we find that $ 2p = \frac{b}{a} $, and therefore that $ \frac{c}{a} = p^2 - q \Rightarrow q = (\frac{b}{2a})^2 - \frac{c}{a} $.

  Substituting, we have the following equation:
  \begin{displaymath}
    \left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 - \frac{c}{a}
  \end{displaymath}

  This simple equation can be solved for $ x $ by taking a single square root (remembering
  both positive and negative roots):
  \begin{align*}
    x &= -\frac{b}{2a} \pm \sqrt{\frac{b^2}{4a^2} - \frac{c}{a}} \\
      &= \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

The expression $ \Delta_2 = b^2 - 4ac $ is known as the \textit{discriminant} of the
quadratic, and it determines the nature of the solutions; if $ \Delta_2 = 0 $, there is
one repeated root, while if $ \Delta_2 > 0 $ there are two real roots. We discuss the case
where $ \Delta_2 < 0 $ later on.

\subsection*{Factors}
To create a quadratic equation with given solutions, we write down a linear expression
for each solution that evaluates to zero when the solution is substituted in, and then multiply
them. For example, if we wanted a quadratic equation with the solutions $ x = 2 $ and $ x = 3 $,
we take the two expressions $ x - 2 $ and $ x - 3 $, multiply the left hand sides together
(obtaining $ (x-2)(x-3) = x^2 - 5x + 6 $), and set it to zero.

This works because if we substitute in one of our original solutions (in our
example, 2 or 3) then one of the two parts of the left hand side will become zero
and so the entire left hand side becomes zero.

In general, this idea works for higher-degree equations (like cubics, quartics,
and so on). We can make a cubic with the solutions $ x = -3 $, $ x = 9 $, and
$ x = 13 $ by writing $ 0 = (x+3)(x-9)(x-13) $.

We can even multiply together higher-degree polynomials to create a polynomial
that has the roots of all of them --- if (for example) we take the equation
$ (x^2 - 4)(x^2 - 9) = 0 $, it will have the four solutions $ x = \pm 2 $ and $ x = \pm 3 $.

The polynomials which multiply together together to form a larger polynomial are known
as \textit{factors} of the larger polynomial, and the process of splitting a polynomial
into factors is known as \textit{factorising}.

        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Then $ x = \frac{1}{2} \left( (\alpha + \beta) + (\alpha - \beta) \right)
                         = \frac{1}{2} \left( (\alpha + \beta) + \sqrt{(\alpha - \beta)^2} \right) $.
          \item Note that $ \sqrt{(\alpha - \beta)^2} $ has two values and show that taking the negative
                value still gives a root.
          \item But $ \alpha + \beta = -b $ and $ (\alpha - \beta)^2 = b^2 - 4c $.
          \item So $ x = \frac{1}{2} \left( -b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4c} \right) $, which is the quadratic formula.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Higher-degree Polynomials}
Before we go any further, we must define the notion of a polynomial. A formal definition
allows us to reason exactly about a mathematical object with more precision than our
intuition.

\begin{defn}[Polynomial]
  A \emph{polynomial} is an expression that only has constant terms and terms involving
  powers of some variable. All polynomials can be written in the form
  $ a_n x^n + \cdots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 $, where $ x $ is the variable and
  $ a_{n...0} $ are the coefficients (and $ a_n \neq 0 $).

  The value $ n $ is called the \emph{degree} of the polynomial --- i.e. the degree of a
  quadratic equation is 2. Given a polynomial $ p $, we can write its degree as $ \partial p $.
\end{defn}

\subsection*{Factorising and Division}
We can find solutions to general polynomial equations $ p(x) = 0 $ by factorising
them and then finding the zeros of each factor. This is the reverse of the process
outlined in the previous section for creating polynomials with an arbitrary number of solutions.

\textbf{Solving a polynomial equation is equivalent to finding its factors.}

For example, if we take the equation $ x^2 + 3x + 2 $ then we can see that two factors of this are $ (x+1) $ and
$ (x+2) $ (because $ x^2 + 3x + 2 = (x+1)(x+2) $). The two solutions are therefore $ x = -1 $
and $ x = -2 $.

Formally, we say that a polynomial $ g(x) $ is a factor of a polynomial $ p(x) $ if there is some polynomial
$ q(x) $ (the quotient) such that $ p(x) = g(x) \cdot q(x) $. In this case, we say that $ p(x) $
divided by $ g(x) $ is $ q(x) $. Even if $ g(x) $ is not a factor of $ p(x) $, it is possible to
write that $ p(x) = g(x) \cdot q(x) + r(x) $ for some remainder polynomial $ r $ if the degree of
$ g(x) $ is less than or equal to the degree of $ p(x) $. This is similar to the division of
integers: $ 11 = 2 \times 5 + 1 $ where the factor is 2, the quotient is 5, and the remainder is 1.

Higher-degree polynomials are much harder to factorise and solve. However,
once we find one factor we can divide it out to obtain a simpler polynomial. For example,
take the cubic $ x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 2 = 0$. We can see that one solution is $ x = 1 $ (it
is usually a good idea to try simple solutions like 1 and 0 first), and therefore one
factor of the equation is $ (x-1) $. If we divide out the cubic by this factor, we obtain
that $ x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 2 = (x-1)(x^2+3x+2) $, and we can solve the quadratic easily! The
three solutions to this cubic are therefore $ x = 1 $, $ x = -1 $, and $ x = -2 $. The following
graph shows both the cubic (in blue) and its factors (in purple), to illustrate this idea.

\begin{center}\fbox{
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
    xlabel=$x$,
    ylabel={$y$},
    axis lines=middle,
    scale=.8
  ]
    \addplot[domain=-3:2, samples=100, color=CornflowerBlue]{ x^3 + 2*x^2 - x - 2};
    \addplot[domain=-3:2, samples=5, color=purple]{ x - 1 };
    \addplot[domain=-3:2, samples=5, color=purple]{ x + 1 };
    \addplot[domain=-3:2, samples=5, color=purple]{ x + 2 };
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
}\\
\textit{The solutions to an equation are exactly the solutions of its factors.}
\end{center}

If we know that the solutions to a polynomial are integers, we need only try the factors
of the constant term as this term is simply the product of the roots of the polynomial.

One algorithm to divide one polynomial by another is long division, such as the following
calculation which provides us with an example of the division of a polynomial by another that is not a factor.

\begin{center}
  \polylongdiv{x^4 + x - 3}{x^2 - 1}
\end{center}

Here, we have divided $ p(x) = x^4 + x - 3 $ by $ g(x) = x^2 - 1 $ to obtain the quotient $ q(x) = x^2 + 1 $
and the remainder $ r(x) = x - 2 $ --- i.e. we can write $ x^4 + x - 3 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) + x - 2 $.

\subsection*{The Remainder Theorem}
One important theorem that follows from the idea of polynomial division is the remainder theorem.

\begin{thm}[Remainder Theorem]
  If we can write $ p(x) = (x-a) q(x) + r $, then $ p(a) = r $.
\end{thm}

Here we are dividing a polynomial $ p(x) $ by some other
linear equation $ (x-a) $, to get a quotient $ q(x) $ and a remainder $ r $
(which is just a number, not a polynomial, in this case). It follows that the
remainder is just the value of $ p(x) $ evaluated at $ a $.

\begin{proof}
  If we substitute $ a $ into the statement above, it simplifies and we obtain that
  $ p(a) = (a - a)q(a) + r = 0\cdot q(a) + r = r $.
\end{proof}

An important consequence of this theorem is that if $ a $ is a solution to the
polynomial, then $ r = p(a) = 0 $ and so $ (x - a) $ is a factor. As we expect,
the solutions to an equation are the same as the solutions to the factors of the equation.

If we can divide out a polynomial multiple times by a factor, we call the
root(s) corresponding to that factor "repeated." The \textit{multiplicity}
of some root $ \alpha $ of $ p(x) = 0 $ is the number of times which we can divide out the factor
$ (x - \alpha) $ from $ p(x) $ --- in other words, the number of times that
the root is repeated.

A second application of the remainder theorem is less obvious --- we can
use it to evaluate polynomials. For example, we can use the remainder theorem
to find $ f(4) $ if $ f(x) = 4x^{17} - 4x^{16} + 3x^4 - 6x + 12 $ by dividing $ f(x) $
by $ (x - 4) $ and taking the remainder.

\section{Complex Numbers}
There are some polynomials which do not have real solutions. All linear equations have
solutions (as seen above, all those which do not pass through the $x$-axis are of
the form $ 1 = 0 $) --- but a simple example of a quadratic that is unsolvable \emph{in
the reals} is $ x^2 + 1 = 0 $ (where $ \Delta_2 < 0 $). The solutions to this
equation would be $ \pm\sqrt{-1} $, and we can't take the square root of a negative number.

As mathematicians, we will now define our way out of this problem.

If we define a new number $ i $ which satisfies the equation $ i^2 = -1 $ (engineers often use $ j $; they are wrong), we can
now solve \emph{all} polynomials for solutions in the form $ a + ib$ for $ a, b \in \mathbb{R} $
(i.e. $ a $ and $ b $ being real numbers)! These numbers are known as the \emph{complex numbers}, and a number
involving $ i $ is \emph{imaginary}. The name is a misnomer, however --- the complex numbers are just as real
as the real numbers.

This is similar to the way we extend the natural numbers to the integers (in order to make subtraction
well-defined), the integers to the rationals (in order to make division well-defined), and the rationals
to the reals (to fill in the `gaps' of the former). The complex numbers are generally considered to have
been formally born in Girolamo Cardano's \emph{Ars Magna} in 1545, where he introduces them only to dismiss
them as `as subtle as they are useless'.

We say that two complex numbers are equal \textbf{if and only if both the real and imaginary
parts of those numbers are equal}, and we perform arithmetic on complex numbers in the same
way that we perform arithmetic on the reals, remembering that $ i^2 = -1 $.

The set of all complex numbers is usually denoted by $ \mathbb{C} $.

\subsection*{Argand diagrams}
We can interpet complex numbers geometrically by plotting them on a Cartesian plane
where the $ x $-axis is the real part of the number and the $y$-axis the imaginary
part. This is known as an \emph{Argand diagram} after Jean-Robert Argand, a French mathematician who was the
first to publish a geometric interpretation of the complex numbers and rigorously prove the Fundamental Theorem
of Algebra (that an $n$th degree polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root).

\begin{center}\fbox{
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
    xlabel=$\realp{z}$,
    ylabel={$\imagp{z}$},
    axis lines=middle,
    scale=.8
  ]
    \addplot[color=Emerald, mark=o]
    coordinates {
      (0, 1)
    };
    \addplot[color=Emerald, mark=o]
    coordinates {
      (1, 0)
    };
    \addplot[color=Emerald, mark=o]
    coordinates {
      (3,2)
    };
    \addplot[color=Emerald, mark=o]
    coordinates {
      (-1,-1)
    };
    \addplot[color=Emerald, mark=o]
    coordinates {
      (-1,2)
    };
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
}\end{center}

The five points marked on this Argand diagram are $ i $, 1, $ 3+2i $, $ -1 - i $,
and $ 2i - 1 $. See if you can label each point on the diagram itself.

\subsection*{Complex Conjugates}
One useful operation is complex conjugation --- if $ z = a+bi $, the
\emph{complex conjugate} of $ z $ is $ \overline z = a-bi $. If a polynomial has
real coefficents, any complex roots must come in conjugate pairs (and so any
polynomial of odd order must have at least one real root). This last idea can be
demonstrated by noting that odd polynomials must cross the $ x$-axis at at least
one point, while even polynomials need not cross the $ x$-axis at all.

The complex conjugate of a complex number is its reflection across the $ x$-axis
of an Argand diagram.

\subsection*{Arithmetic of Complex Numbers}
Suppose we have two complex numbers, $ x = a + bi $ and $ y = c + di $. We have
the following rules for addition and subtraction by collecting the real and imaginary
terms together:
\begin{align*}
  x + y &= (a + c) + (b + d)i, \text{ and} \\
  x - y &= (a - c) + (b - d)i.
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Exercises I}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Evaluate the following expressions, and plot the answers on an Argand diagram:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item $ (3+2i) + (6-2i) $
          \item $ 24 - (6 + 2i) $
          \item $ 2(2+i) + 6i - 7 $
        \end{enumerate}
  \item If we add two real numbers, can we obtain an imaginary number? If we add two
        imaginary numbers, can we obtain a real number?
  \item Let $ v = 3-7i $ and $ w = -4+6i $.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Find the real numbers $ p $ and $ q $ such that $ pv + qw = 6.5 - 11i $.
      \item Show that any complex number $ z $ can be written as $ z = pv + qw $ for some real $ p $ and $ q $.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Solve the quadratic equation $ x^2 + 4 = 0 $.
  \item Prove that $ z + \overline z = 2 \cdot \realp{z} $ and $ z - \overline z = 2i \cdot \imagp{z} $.
  \item Verify the following properties of conjugation.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $ \overline {\overline z} = z $
      \item $ \overline w + \overline z = \overline{w + z} $
      \item $ \overline w \overline z = \overline{wz} $
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Find $ i^{957} $.
  \item Show that $ \abs{a + bi} \geq \abs{a} $ and $ \abs{a + bi} \geq \abs{b} $.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Polar Form}
Multiplication of complex numbers is more involved than addition or subtraction
because each complex number consists of two terms.
\begin{displaymath}
  (a+bi)(c+di) = ac + adi + bci + bdi^2 = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i
\end{displaymath}

Multiplication and division of complex numbers can be made much simpler by rewriting them
in \emph{polar form}. Instead of writing the number in the form $ z = x + yi $, where $ x $ and $ y $
are the distances from the two axes, we write $ z = r \cis \theta $, where $ r $ is the distance
of the number from the origin (known as the \emph{modulus} and written as $ \abs{z} $) and $ \theta $
is the angle that the line connecting the number to the origin makes with the $ x$-axis (known as
the \emph{argument} and written as $ \carg(z) $).

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{polarnew}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Looking at the triangle formed, we find that $ r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} $ and $ \theta = \tan^{-1}{\frac{b}{a}} $.

This new notation simplifies multiplication significantly, because it can be shown
that $ (r \cis \theta)(t \cis \varphi) = (rt) \cis (\theta + \varphi) $ (the proof of this
is an exercise). For example, if we were to multiply $ 3 \cis \pi $ by $ 4 \cis \pi $, we
would obtain $ 12 \cis 2\pi = 12 $. This is as expected, as $ p \cis \pi = -p $, and $ -3 \times -4 = 12 $.

Note that any complex number has an infinite number of different representations in polar
form, simply by adding $ 2\pi $ (an entire rotation around the origin) to its argument. This
fact comes into play later on when we try to solve equations involving powers of complex
numbers.

The "$ x + yi $" form which we have been using so far is known as \emph{rectangular form}.

\subsection*{Euler's Identity}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{stars}\\
    \small{\textit{From \url{http://brownsharpie.courtneygibbons.org/?p=848}}}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
It is possible to calculate powers of complex numbers using \emph{Euler's formula},
\begin{displaymath}
  \cis \theta = e^{i\theta}.
\end{displaymath}
From this we obtain the following equation, which relates five fundamental mathematical constants
in one expression and which some have called the most beautiful equation in mathematics:
\begin{equation}
  \tag{Euler's Identity}
  e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
\end{equation}

A simple proof of Euler's formula, using calculus, is presented here.

\begin{proof}
  We wish to show that $ \frac{e^{i\theta}}{\cos\theta+i\sin\theta} = 1 $. Note that $ \cis\theta \neq 0 $ for all $ \theta $.

  Suppose $ f $ is a function of $ \theta $, defined by $ f(\theta) = \frac{e^{i\theta}}{\cos\theta+i\sin\theta} $.
  Then, taking the derivative, we have
  \begin{align*}
    \od{f}{\theta} &= \frac{(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta) \cdot i e^{i\theta} - e^{i\theta} \cdot (-\sin \theta + i \cos \theta)}{\cis^2 \theta}\\
                   &= \frac{ie^{i\theta}\cos\theta - e^{i\theta}\sin\theta + e^{i\theta}\sin\theta - ie^{i\theta}\cos\theta}{\cis^2\theta}\\
                   &= 0.
  \end{align*}
  So $ f $ is a constant function, and so has the same value for all $ \theta $. But $ f(0) = \frac{e^{i\cdot 0}}{\cos 0 + i\sin 0} = 1 $;
  so $ \frac{e^{i\theta}}{\cos\theta+i\sin\theta} = 1 $ for all $ \theta $.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Coordinate Geometry}
As mentioned above, we can view the complex numbers as points in the plane, $ \mathbb{R}^2 $. This means
that we can carry out geometric operations algebraically using complex numbers. For example, the length
of the line joining two points $ z_1 $ and $ z_2 $ is simply $ \abs{z_1 - z_2} $.

We define the \textit{locus} of an equation to be the set of all points satisfying that equation; for example,
the locus of $ x^2 + y^2 = 1 $ is the set of all points making up the unit circle.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Roots of Unity}
Let us take the equation $ z^3 = 1 $. We know that this equation has exactly three complex
roots, and of these we already know that the only real root is $ z = 1 $. How can we find
the two non-real roots?

Noting that $ 1 = 1 \cis 2k\pi $ for all natural numbers $ k $, we can apply de~Moivre's~Theorem
to show that $ 1^{(\frac{1}{3})} = \cis \frac{2k\pi}{3} $.

We can then set $ n $ to 0, 1, and 2 to obtain our three roots of the original
equation: $ z = 1 $, $ z = \cis \frac{2\pi}{3} $, and $ z = \cis \frac{4\pi}{3} $
respectively. Note that if we set $ k $ to any higher number (3, for example) we
obtain one of the roots we already have (e.g. $ \cis \frac{6\pi}{3} = 1 $), since we
have gone `around the circle'.

If we look at the roots geometrically (on an Argand diagram like that above), we see that
the $ n$th roots of 1 will be arranged in a circle of radius $ 1 $ centred on the origin, and the
angles between them will be exactly $ \frac{2\pi}{n} $. If $ n $ is even, both 1 and -1 will both
be real roots, but if $ n $ is odd then 1 will be the only real root. In general, the sum of all
$ n $ $n$th roots of unity is zero (see exercise \ref{ex:rootsum}).

Any integer power of an $n$th root of unity is also an $n$th root of unity. However, not
all $ n$th roots will "generate" all the other ones in this way; for example, $ \cis \frac{2\pi}{3} $
is a sixth root of unity but will miss out every second sixth root if we raise it to integer
powers. Roots which \emph{do} generate all the others are called \emph{primitive roots of unity}.

We formally define a primitive $n$th root of unity to be a complex number $ \omega $ such that $ \omega^n = 1$
but $ \omega^k \neq 1 $ for all $ k < n $. In other words, if we list all the roots of unity in order for $ n = 1,~2,~3 $
and so on, then a root is only primitive for that value of $ n $ for which it first appears.

For example, $ \mu = \cis \frac{2\pi}{3} $ is a primitive third root of unity (since the smallest
nonzero $ n $ such that $ \mu^n = 1 $ is $ n = 3 $).

\clearpage
We now prove that, as we claimed, the primitive $n$th roots of unity "generate" all the other
$ n$th roots of unity:
\begin{thm}
  Given the polynomial $ z^n = 1 $, with primitive root $ \omega $, all solutions
  are given by $ \omega^k $ for $ 0 \leq k \leq (n - 1) $. In other words,
  the integer powers of a primitive $ n$th root of unity must be \emph{all} the
  $n$th roots of unity.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  We first prove that all the powers $ \omega^k $ for $ k $ defined above are distinct.
  Suppose that there are two values for $ k $, say
  $ k = a $ and $ k = b $, such that $ \omega^a = \omega^b $ and $ a \neq b $. Then we have
  that $ \omega^{a-b} = 1 $ and therefore $ a - b = 0 $ (the other possibility here would be
  that $ a - b $ were equal to some non-zero multiple of $ n $, none of which are possible
  values of $ k $) so $ a = b $.

  Since there are $ n $ possible values for $ k $, there are $ n $ distinct powers of $ \omega $
  which are all roots of the polynomial. However, the polynomial is of degree $ n $ and so has
  exactly $ n $ roots --- thus, the powers of $ \omega $ are exactly the roots of the polynomial.
\end{proof}

Roots of unity allow us to find all the $ n$th roots of any number easily. Suppose $ a^n = x $; then
the $ n$th roots of $ x $ will be $ a = \omega^k \sqrt[n]{x} $ ($ 0 \leq k < n $) where $ \omega $ is a
primitive $ n$th root of unity and $ \sqrt[n]{x} $ is any $ n$th root of $ x $.

\subsection*{Exercises}
For the exercises marked $ \dagger $, it may be useful to use the result that for all integers $ a $ and $ b $
there exist integers $ m $ and $ n $ such that $ am + bn = \gcd(a,b) $ (where the $ \gcd $ of two numbers is the
largest integer that divides into both of them). Two integers $ a $ and $ b $ are coprime if they share

\section{The Double-Triangle Problem}
As an application of our work on primitive roots, we solve the \emph{double-triangle problem} which appeared
in the 2009 New Zealand Scholarship examination.

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{double_triangle}

The question states that the positive real solution is $ z_1 = k = k \cis 0 $. We
can therefore see that the other two solutions on the outer circle will be given
by $ z_2 = k \cis \frac{2\pi}{3} $ and $ z_3 = k \cis \frac{-2\pi}{3} $.

The negative real solution will have the same real part as the two complex solutions
on the outer circle; we can calculate this by taking $ z_4 = k \cos \frac{2\pi}{3} = -\frac{k}{2} $.
We can find the other two solutions on the inside circle by rotating our negative
real solution by $ \frac{2\pi}{3} $, obtaining $ z_5 = \frac{k}{2} \cis (\pi - \frac{2\pi}{3}) = \frac{k}{2} \cis \frac{\pi}{3} $
and $ z_6 = \frac{k}{2} \cis \frac{-\pi}{3} $.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular} {c | c | c}
  \textbf{Root} & \textbf{Polar form} & \textbf{Rectangular form}\\
  $ z_1 $ & $ k \cis 0 $                         & $ k $\\
  $ z_2 $ & $ k \cis \frac{2\pi}{3} $            & $ -\frac{k}{2} + i\frac{k\sqrt{3}}{2} $\\
  $ z_3 $ & $ k \cis \frac{-2\pi}{3} $           & $ -\frac{k}{2} - i\frac{k\sqrt{3}}{2} $\\
  $ z_4 $ & $ \frac{k}{2} \cis \pi $             & $ -\frac{k}{2} $\\
  $ z_5 $ & $ \frac{k}{2} \cis \frac{\pi}{3} $   & $ \frac{k}{4} + i\frac{k\sqrt{3}}{4} $\\
  $ z_6 $ & $ \frac{k}{2} \cis \frac{-\pi}{3} $   & $ \frac{k}{4} - i\frac{k\sqrt{3}}{4} $\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

We now generate our polynomial using the techniques described in the section on
quadratic equations:
\begin{align*}
  f(x) &= (x - z_1)(x - z_4) = \left(x -k\right)\left(x + \frac{k}{2}\right)\\
  g(x) &= (x - z_2)(x - z_3) = \left(x - \left(-\frac{k}{2} + i\frac{k\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\right)\left(x - \left(-\frac{k}{2} - i\frac{k\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\right)\\
       &= x^2 - \frac{k}{2}x + \frac{k^2}{4}\\
  h(x) &= (x - z_5)(x - z_6) = \left(x - \left(\frac{k}{4} + i\frac{k\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)\right)\left(x - \left(\frac{k}{4} - i\frac{k\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)\right)\\
       &= x^2 + kx + k^2\\
  \therefore~p(x) &= f(x)g(x)h(x) = \left(x -k\right)\left(x + \frac{k}{2}\right)\left(x^2 - \frac{k}{2}x + \frac{k^2}{4}\right)\left(x^2 + kx + k^2\right)
\end{align*}

Note that because all of the complex roots come in conjugate pairs the imaginary parts
cancel leaving us with a sextic polynomial with real coefficients.

\subsection*{Exercises}
Work through the problem, writing out all working clearly. Attempt the problem without
looking at the solution. Describe the main ideas used in each step of the solution,
and make sure you understand why each step is taken and why the solution is correct.

Are there any other possible ways of completing the problem? Is this the only possible
solution?

\section{Solving the Cubic}
This section presents a general solution for the cubic equation similar to the solution
of the quadratic equation given in exercise 3.\ref{ex:quadratificational}. Be sure to complete that
exercise before reading this section. The general outline of this proof is given in \S14
of \emph{Galois Theory} by Harold M. Edwards (Springer-Verlag,~1984).

\subsection*{Historical Background}
\begin{figure}[h]

This particular method of solution was presented first by the French mathematician Alexandre-Th\'eophile Vandermonde
in 1771. However, it is believed that the first person to solve the general cubic equation was the Italian
Scipio de Ferro who passed on at least part of his method to his student Antonio Fior. A solution
was independently discovered at around the same time (in 1535) by Niccolo Fontana (also known as Tartaglia,
the Stammerer), who was conviced to pass them on to another Italian, Girolamo Cardano. Cardano later (in 1545)
published the solution in his book, \emph{Ars Magna}, which also included a solution to the general quartic
by Ludovico Ferrari.

\subsection*{Notation and Preliminary Results}
Suppose we have some polynomial $ t^3 - \sigma_1 t^2 + \sigma_2 t - \sigma_3 $ (note the signs
on the coefficients) with the three complex roots (not necessarily distinct) $ x $, $ y $,
and $ z $. So $ \sigma_1 = x + y + z $, $ \sigma_2 = xy + xz + yz $, and $ \sigma_3 = xyz $,
where $ \sigma_n $ is known as the $ n$th elementary symmetric polynomial in $ x $, $ y $, and $ z $.

We note the following three identities:
\begin{align*}
  x^2z + xy^2 + yz^2 + x^2y + xz^2 + y^2z &= \sigma_1\sigma_2 - 3\sigma_3\\
  x^3 + y^3 + z^3 &= \sigma_1^3 - 3(\sigma_1\sigma_2 - 3\sigma_3) - 6\sigma_3\\
  x^2 + y^2 + z^2 &= \sigma_1^2 - 2\sigma_2
\end{align*}

Finally, let $ \alpha $ be a primitive cube root of 1.

\subsection*{Computations for the Solution}
Note first that
\begin{align*}
  x &= \frac{1}{3}\left( (x + y + z) + (x + \alpha y + \alpha^2 z) + (x + \alpha^2 y + \alpha z) \right)\\
    &= \frac{1}{3}\left( (x + y + z) + \sqrt[3]{(x + \alpha y + \alpha^2 z)^3} + \sqrt[3]{(x + \alpha^2 y + \alpha z)^3} \right)\\
    &= \frac{1}{3}\left( \sigma_1 + \sqrt[3]{(x + \alpha y + \alpha^2 z)^3} + \sqrt[3]{(x + \alpha^2 y + \alpha z)^3} \right)
\end{align*}
(remembering that the three cube roots of 1 add to 0).

Now, we must find expressions for $ u = (x + \alpha y + \alpha^2 z)^3 $ and $ v = (x + \alpha^2 y + \alpha z)^3 $ in terms of
the coefficients of the polynomial, $ \sigma_n $. Suppose that we can find $ uv $ and $ u + v $ in terms of the elementary
symmetric polynomials. Then we can find $ u $ and $ v $ using the quadratic formula.

So what are $ uv $ and $ u + v $?

Expanding $ u $ and $ v $ individually, we find
\begin{align*}
  u &= 3(x^2z + xy^2 + yz^2)\alpha^2 + 3(x^2y + xz^2 + y^2z)\alpha + x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + 6xyz, \text{ and}\\
  v &= 3(x^2z + xy^2 + yz^2)\alpha + 3(x^2y + xz^2 + y^2z)\alpha^2 + x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + 6xyz.
\end{align*}

Adding these together, we have
\begin{align*}
  u + v &= &&  3\alpha(x^2z + xy^2 + yz^2 + x^2y + xz^2 + y^2z)\\
        &  &&+ 3\alpha^2(x^2z + xy^2 + yz^2 + x^2y + xz^2 + y^2z)\\
        &  &&+ 12xyz + 2(x^3 + y^3 + z^3)\\
        &= &&3(\alpha + \alpha^2)(\sigma_1\sigma_2 - 3\sigma_3) + 12\sigma_3 + 2(\sigma_1^3 - 3(\sigma_1\sigma_2 - 3\sigma_3) - 6\sigma_3)\\
        &= &&-3(\sigma_1\sigma_2 - 3\sigma_3) + 12\sigma_3 + 2(\sigma_1^3 - 3(\sigma_1\sigma_2 - 3\sigma_3) - 6\sigma_3)\\
        &= &&2\sigma_1^3 - 9\sigma_1\sigma_2 + 27\sigma_3.
\end{align*}

To find $ uv $, we proceed as follows:
\begin{align*}
  (x + \alpha y + \alpha^2 z)(x + \alpha^2 y + \alpha z) &= (xy + xz + yz)\alpha^2 + (xy + xz + yz)\alpha + x^2 + y^2 + z^2\\
                                                         &= (\alpha + \alpha^2)(\sigma_2) + \sigma_1^2 - 2\sigma_2\\
                                                         &= \sigma_1^2 - 3\sigma_2\\
                                                         &\Downarrow\\
                                                      uv &= (\sigma_1^2 - 3\sigma_2)^3.
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Solution}
So, to find the solutions of a cubic equation $ t^3 - \sigma_1 t^2 + \sigma_2 t - \sigma_3 = 0 $:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Calculate:
    \begin{align*}
      u + v &= 2\sigma_1^3 - 9\sigma_1\sigma_2 + 27\sigma_3\\
      uv    &= (\sigma_1^2 - 3\sigma_2)^3
    \end{align*}
  \item Then calculate:
    \begin{displaymath}
      u,v = \frac{(u+v) \pm \sqrt{(u  + v)^2 - 4uv}}{2}
    \end{displaymath}
  \item Hence, we have nine possible solutions (one for each choice of cube root), of
        which three will work in the original equation (trial and error must be used at this point):
    \begin{align*}
      x &= \frac{1}{3}\left( \sigma_1 + \sqrt[3]{u} + \sqrt[3]{v} \right)
    \end{align*}
    Remember that the three cube roots of a number will be $ \sqrt[3]{u} $, $ \alpha\sqrt[3]{u} $,
    and $ \alpha^2 \sqrt[3]{u} $ where $ \alpha $ is a complex cube root of unity.
\end{enumerate}

A variation of this method also solves quartic equations. However, no general solution to the
quintic equation (or any higher degree equation) exists in terms of radicals (terms under a $ \sqrt{} $).
The lack of a general solution for any polynomial with $ \delta > 5 $ was originally proved by Ruffini
and Abel in the early 1800s, and a general study of the symmetries of the roots of polynomials
(the beginnings of Galois theory) was first published (after being rejected twice) by the
French Academy of Sciences in 1843 after their late author \'Evariste Galois was killed in a duel
over a girl in 1832 (at the age of 20). For more historical details, see the introductory chapter
of Ian Stewart's \emph{Galois Theory}.

\subsection*{Clearing Up Some Technical Points}
How did we know that $ uv $ and $ u + v $ could be expressed in terms of the elementary
symmetric polynomials (the coefficients)? Well, it so happens that $ uv $ and $ u + v $ are
symmetric in $ x $, $ y $, and $ z $ (this is not hard to check), and we have a theorem due
to Sir Isaac Newton which states that:
\begin{thm}[Fundamental Theorem on Symmetric Polynomials]
  Suppose that $ r_1 $, $ r_2 $, ..., $ r_n $ are the roots of some polynomial. Then every
  symmetric polynomial in $ r_1 $, $ r_2 $, ..., $ r_n $ can be expressed (uniquely) as a polynomial
  in the elementary symmetric functions $ \sigma_1 $, $ \sigma_2 $, ..., $ \sigma_n $.
\end{thm}
Note that the elementary symmetric functions of order $ n $ are simply the coefficients of
the polynomial $ (x - a_1)(x - a_2) \cdots (x - a_n) $. For example, the second-order elementary
symmetric functions are just $ \sigma_1 = a_1 + a_2 $ and $ \sigma_2 = a_1 a_2 $; the third-order
elementary symmetric functions are just $ \sigma_1 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 $, $ \sigma_2 = a_1 a_2 + a_1 a_3 + a_2 a_3 $,
and $ \sigma_3 = a_1 a_2 a_3 $.

Basically, the theorem implies that if we have a symmetric expression in the roots of some polynomial,
then we can write that expression in terms of the coefficients of the polynomial.

One example is the discriminant of a polynomial. We have already met the discriminant of a quadratic, $ \Delta_2 = b^2 - 4ac $;
we can more generally define the discriminant of an $ n$th degree polynomial to be
\begin{displaymath}
\Delta_n [(x - \alpha_1)(x - \alpha_2) \cdots (x - \alpha_n)] = \prod_{i < j}(\alpha_i - \alpha_j)^2
\end{displaymath}
which is obviously symmetric in each $ \alpha_i $.

\section{Final Exercises}

\begin{aquote}{John von Neumann}
  In mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them.

These exercises broadly cover the content of the book, and their difficulty
varies! However, in general it is a good idea to look at the exercises in each
section first as they often include some content themselves.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Is $ (x-15) $ a factor of $ (x^3 - 19x - 30) $? Is $ (x^2 + 5x + 6) $ a factor?
  \item Factor completely $ 9x^4 - 13x^2 + 4 $.
  \item Solve $ x^3 + 9x^2 = 60 - 8x $.
  \item Find $ k $ such that $ (x - 4) $ is a factor of $ x^3 + 7x^2 - 14x + k $.
  \item Find a value of $ k \neq 0 $ such that $ kx^2 -6x + 1 = 0 $ will have just one root.
  \item Find all sixth roots of $ i $.
  \item Find $ k $ such that $ 8 - x +  2\sqrt{2x + k} = 0 $ has exactly one real root.
  \item Solve $ (\alpha^2 + 2\alpha -4)(\alpha^7 + 1) = 0 $.
  \item Solve $ x^4 + x^2 + 1 = 0 $ for $ x $.
  \hard Solve $ \beta^2 + \beta + 1 = 0 $ for $ x $ if $ \beta = x^2 + x + 1 $.
  \hard Let $ \alpha $, $ \beta $, and $ \gamma $ be the three roots of $ ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 $. Prove that:
        \begin{enumerate*}
          \item $ \alpha + \beta + \gamma = \frac{-b}{a} $,
          \item $ \alpha\beta + \beta\gamma + \alpha\gamma = \frac{c}{a} $, and
          \item $ \alpha\beta\gamma = \frac{-d}{a} $.
        \end{enumerate*}
        Hence show that $ \alpha^2\beta\gamma + \alpha\beta^2\gamma + \alpha\beta\gamma^2 = \frac{bd}{a^2} $.
  \item Solve $ (z+1)^3 = 8(z-1)^3 $ for $ z $. Give exact answers in the form $ a + ib $.
  \item Graph the equation $ \abs{z} = 3 $ in the complex plane.
  \item If $ z = 1+i $ and $ w = \frac{1}{z} + i $, find the argument of $ w $.
  \hard If $ \frac{z + 2i}{z-2i} $ is purely imaginary, describe the possible values of $ z $.
  \item If $ \abs{z - 1 + 2i} = \abs{z + 1} $ and $ z = x+yi $, find an expression for $ y $ in terms
        of $ x $ (i.e. find the \emph{locus} of $ z $).
  \item Sketch the region satisfied by $ \realp{z - i \overline z} > 2 $.
  \item If $ x = 2 $ and $ x = 6 $ are solutions of $ p(x) = Ax^2 + Bx + C $ and $ p(0) = -4 $,
        find $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $.
  \item If $ w = 2-3i $ is a zero of $ 3w^3 - 14w^2 + Aw - 26 $ (where $ A $ is real), find $ A $
        and the remaining two roots.
  \hard Use de Moivre's Theorem to show that
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item $ \sin 2\theta = 2\sin\theta\cos\theta $ and $ \cos 2\theta = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta $; and
          \item $ \sin 3\theta = 3\sin\theta - 4\sin^3\theta $ and $ \cos 3\theta = 4\cos^3\theta - 3\cos\theta $.
        \end{enumerate}
  \item Use Euler's formula to prove that $ \cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta $, and that
        $ \sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta $.
  \harder Show that $ \arctan a + \arctan b = \arctan \frac{a + b}{1 - ab} $.
  \hard Suppose that $ \abs{z+w} = \abs{z-w} $. Show that $ \carg z - \carg w = \pm \frac{\pi}{2} $. You
        may, if necessary, use the result from above that $ \arctan u - \arctan v = \arctan\left(\frac{u-v}{1+uv} \right) $.
  \hard If $ 3z^3 + (2-3ai)z^2 + (6+2bi)z + 4 $ is to have exactly one real root, what value must
        the quotient $ \frac{b}{a} $ take if $ a,b \in \mathbb{R} $? Find the real root.
  \hard Complex numbers exist in a plane, and so can be used to solve problems in geometry. For example, multiplication
        by $ i $ rotates a point by $ \frac{\pi}{2} $ around the origin. A generalisation of this allows us to rotate
        a point $ z $ around an arbitrary point $ a $ by that angle: $ z' = a + i(z-a) $.

        A pirate named Kim Dotcom has hidden his sick tunes on a desert island tax haven in order to evade
        American FBI agents. You have been hired to find the data stick containing his mp3 files so that
        his extradition case can be resolved, but all you can find is a treasure map with the following
        instructions:

        \begin{aquote}{Kim Dotcom's Amazing Totally Secret Treasure Map\textsuperscript{TM}}
          From the statue of Richard Seddon, go to the kauri tree (counting your steps), and then turn
          exactly 90\degree left and walk the same number of steps to the point $ g' $. Returning
          to the statue, walk to the beech tree (again counting your steps). Turn right by 90\degree,
          and walk the same number of steps to point $ g'' $. The treasure is buried exactly at the midpoint
          of the line joining $ g' $ and $ g'' $.
        \end{aquote}

        Given that the kauri tree is at $ (0,0) $, the beech tree is at $ (10,0) $, and
        the statue is somewhere on the line $ y = 2009 $, find the location of the treasure
        using the geometry of complex numbers and rid New Zealand of Kim Dotcom forever.\footnote{~Problem taken
        from Kessler (2009) section 5.1.}

  \hard Find all possible values for $ \theta $ if $ \cis^2 \theta + \cis \theta + 1 = 0 $.
  \item Graph the locus of $ \carg w = \abs{w} $. What about $ \carg w + \abs {w} = 1 $?
  \item Given a quadratic equation $ x^2 + px + q $ and a root $ \alpha $, show that the other root $ \beta $ is
        given by $ \beta = -p - \alpha $ and find a similar expression for finding two roots of a cubic given the
        third.
  \item Suppose $ p $ is a quadratic (i.e. $ p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c $ for some $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $). Suppose further
        that $ p(0) = 9 $, and $ p(3) = 0 $. How many distinct roots does $ p $ have?
  \hard An important identity (known as the \emph{sum of two squares})
        is that $ x^2 + y^2 = (x-iy)(x+iy) $. Use this identity to prove
        that if $ m $ and $ n $ are integers that can be written as the sum of two
        squares, then their product $ mn $ can also be written as a sum of two squares.
  \item Solve the following system of equations:
        \begin{align*}
          x^2 + 4xy + y^2 &= 2\\
          x^2 - 2xy + y^2 &= -4
        \end{align*}
  \item Suppose $ \omega $ is a primitive cube root of unity. Show that
        \begin{displaymath}
          y_2 = \omega \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}(-1 + \sqrt{5})} + \omega^2 \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}(-1 - \sqrt{5})}
        \end{displaymath}
        and
        \begin{displaymath}
          y_3 = \omega^2 \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}(-1 + \sqrt{5})} + \omega \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}(-1 - \sqrt{5})}
        \end{displaymath}
        are complex conjugates.
  \item Find all solutions to $ x^{n - 1} + x^{n - 2} + \cdots + 1 = 0 $, where $ n \in \mathbb{N} $.
  \item \label{ex:solutiongenerator}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Let $ p(x) = \sum^n_{r = 0} p_r x^r $ be a polynomial with real coefficients. If $ p(z) = 0 $,
            then $ p(\overline{z}) = 0 $. (This is a generalisation of 5.\ref{ex:conjquadratic} to arbitrary degree polynomials.)
      \item Let $ p(x) = \sum^n_{r = 0} p_r x^{2r} $ be a polynomial with real coefficients and only even powers of $ x $.
            If $ p(a + bi) = 0 $, then $ p(\pm a \pm bi) = 0 $ for all possible combinations of $ \pm $.
    \end{enumerate}
  \hard Under which conditions will the equation $ x^2 + a(1+i)x + b(1+i) = 0 $ have one or more
        real solutions where $ a, b \in \mathbb{R} $?
  \item Find the complex number $ z $ which satisfies $ \carg(z - 1 - i) = -\frac{\pi}{6} $ and
        $ \carg(z - 1 + i) = \frac{\pi}{6} $.
  \harder Find all integer values of $ a $ and $ b $ such that $ \frac{a^2+b^2}{ab} $ is an integer.
  \harder Let $ w $ and $ z $ be complex numbers, and let $ u = w + z $ and $ v = w^2 + z^2 $. Prove
          that $ w $ and $ z $ are real \textbf{if and only if} $ u $ and $ v $ are real and $ u^2 \leq 2v$.
  \hard Suppose $ x + \frac{1}{x} = 1 $.
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Show, without calculating $ x $, that we must necessarily have
            \begin{displaymath}
              x^7 + \frac{1}{x^7} = 1
            \end{displaymath}
          \item Calculate the possible values of $ x $ and verify this fact.
        \end{enumerate}
  \harder Calculate $ i^i $.
  \item Let $ \mathbb{R}[\epsilon] $ be the real numbers together with some new element $ \epsilon \neq 0 $ such that $ \epsilon^2 = 0 $.
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Does there exist $ \beta $ in $ \mathbb{R}[\epsilon] $ such that $ \beta \epsilon = 1 $ (i.e. does $ \epsilon $ have a multiplicative
                inverse)?
          \item When does $ (a + b\epsilon)^{-1} $ exist?
          \item Solve $ x^2 - 1 = 2\epsilon $ in $ \mathbb{R}[\epsilon] $.
        \end{enumerate}
  \item Take the polynomial $ x^2 = 4 $ in the integers modulo 6 (i.e. the integers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
        such that $ 4 + 1 = 0 $). Solve for all possible values of $ x $.
  \item \textbf{Bonus exercise I:} In general, what numbers will work in the place of $ 3 $ and $ 9 $ in the XKCD
        comic at the bottom of the bibliography?
  \item \textbf{Bonus exercise II:} Notice that $ \frac{3}{16} - \frac{3}{19} = \frac{3}{16} \cdot \frac{3}{19} $.
        For which values of $ a $, $ b $, and $ d $ is the identity $ \frac{a}{b} - \frac{a}{d} = \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{a}{d} $ true?
