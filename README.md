# NCEA/Scholarship Notes
These notes pertain to several NZ NCEA/Scholarship standards. I have split them into folders per subject, and the original
LaTeX code is available for most. Any errata/feedback encouraged either via email or the issue tracker.

Hopefully the folder structure is relatively straightforward.

## University Mathematics Book Reviews/Bibliography
See [this page](unibooks.md). Very work-in-progress; please note the disclaimer.

## Mathematics
### Level One
I am not currently tutoring L1, there is not much I have to add in the way of notes as most of the material
is either revision from Y9/10 or simple calculations.
 * Algebra (91027) and Tables, Equations and Graphs (91028): [weekly exercises](L1%20Maths/Algebra/algebra.pdf)
 * Trigonometry (91032): [worksheet](L1%20Maths/Trigonometry/level_1_trig.pdf), [homework](L1%20Maths/Trigonometry/level_1_trig1_hw.pdf).
 * Practice exams: [Algebra](L1%20Maths/Algebra/algebra_paper1.pdf)

### Level Two
My new Level Two Mathematics notes are available [here](L2%20Maths/bookform.pdf). The sheets include:
 1. (2.1) 		Coordinate Geometry
 2. (2.4)		Arcs and Sectors of Circles
 3. (2.4) 		Trigonometry
 4. (2.2) 		Functions
 5. (2.2/2.6) 	Quadratic Modelling
 6. (2.6/2.14) 	Simultaneous Equations
 7. (2.6/2.14) 	Linear Inequations
 8. (2.6) 		The Quadratic Formula
 9. (2.2/2.6)	Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
 10. (2.2/2.6) 	Negative and Fractional Powers
 11. (2.7) 		Slopes and Differentiation
 12. (2.7) 		Tangent Lines and Approximation
 13. (2.7) 		Turning Points Optimisation
 14. (2.7) 		Anti-differentiation
 15. (2.7) 		Kinematics and Rates of Change
 16. (Stats?)	Counting and Combinatorics
 17. (2.3) 		Number Sequences and Fractals
 18. (2.5) 		Graphs and Networks

I am not currently planning any stats notes.

### Level Three and Scholarship Calculus
I am currently in the process of reworking and reorganising my L3 maths notes; the final plan will be to have the following
sets of notes, broadly in the given logical order and aligned with the L2 notes above:
1. _Down the River: Foundations for Scholarship_. a [set of notes](L3%20Maths/Foundations/foundations.pdf) covering basic set theory, combinatorics,
   and number theory, with proof writing and induction.
2. Linear programming (91574) and simultaneous equations (91587). a [set of notes](L3%20Maths/Linear/linear.pdf) from a proof-based
   perspective, although most non-easy proofs are clearly marked and optional. Some exercises are included.
3. Trigonometry (91575). a [set of notes](L3%20Maths/Trigonometry/trigonometry.pdf) which covers the definition of the trigonometric functions
   and proves various identities, with a view towards mix of geometric and analytical thinking.
4. Calculus (91578 and 91579). a [set of notes](L3%20Maths/Calculus/bookform.pdf) containing both tutorial session material and homeworks
   with material ranging in difficulty from achieved to outstanding scholarship.
5. Algebra (91577): a set of notes entitled [_Solutions_](L3%20Maths/Algebra/solutions.pdf) designed for self-study for scholarship students
   (with [full answers to exercises](L3%20Maths/Algebra/solutions2.pdf)). There are a number of sections for further reading beyond the required
   material.
6. [WIP] Conic Sections. This is currently a WIP.

One should note that the majority of my notes are at a slightly higher level than is strictly required. As such, students should be
guided through skipping or only lightly touching some sections (for example, the functional definition of the trig functions in my
trig notes is only of use to students that are very comfortable with the geometric definition of the functions from L2 or earlier).

## Physics
### Level Two
 * Waves (91170), mechanics (91171), and electromagnetism (91172): [full set of notes](L2%20Physics/externals.pdf), including many diagrams and links to youtube videos,
   but (by design) with limited exercises. To be used with a workbook or similar set of problems.
 * Practice exams: [mechanics](L2%20Physics/Exams/mech.pdf), [electromagnetism](L2%20Physics/Exams/edyn.pdf), and [waves](L2%20Physics/Exams/waves.pdf).

I do not intend to write modern physics notes for L2 at this point in time; my L3 notes revise this material and so can be used for this purpose.

### Level Three
 * Waves (91523), mechanics (91524), modern physics (91525), and electromagnetism (91526): [full set of notes](L3%20Physics/externals.pdf), much terser and much
   longer than level 2, ideal for motivated students for self-study. A large amount of interest material in modern physics is included. Recommend L2 calculus
   with concurrent L3 calculus, but not strictly required. (Very short summary of required mathematics in introductory chapter.)
 * Problem sets related to the above notes can be found [in a subfolder](L3%20Physics/sheets).

## General Science (Level One)
 * [Scientific Investigations and the Scientific Method](L1%20Science/Scientific%20Investigations.odt)
 * Biology (90948): [01 - Genetics and DNA](L1%20Science/Biology/level_1_bio_genes.pdf), [02 - Inheritance and Variation](L1%20Science/Biology/level_1_bio_inheritance.pdf), [03 - Reproduction and Variation](L1%20Science/Biology/level_1_bio_reprod.pdf)
 * Chemistry (90944): [Notes](L1%20Science/Chemistry/notes.pdf)

## Classical Studies
### Scholarship
 * [General exam advice](Scholarship%20Classics/examadvice.pdf).
 * [Basic reading list for a Greek focus](Scholarship%20Classics/reading%20lists.odt).
 * Aristophanes: [practice questions](Scholarship%20Classics/Aristophanes/aristophanes%20questions.odt) and [timeline](Scholarship%20Classics/Aristophanes/aristophanes%20timeline.odt).
 * Alexander the Great: [random notes on sources and early life](Scholarship%20Classics/Alexander%20the%20Great/sources%20and%20early%20life.odt).

**In progress:** Homeworks (and some other notes) for Alexander, general bibliography. Final plan is to have a full reading course written.

## Geography
 * [Key concepts](Geography/Key%20Concepts.odt).
 * Skills practice exams: Mahia: [Questions](Geography/L3-Skills-Mahia-qns.pdf), [Resources](Geography/L3-Skills-Mahia-res.pdf); Chatham Islands: [Questions](Geography/L3-Skills-Chathams-qns.pdf), [Resources](Geography/L3-Skills-Chathams-res.pdf)

## Other in progress
I hope to begin work on specific notes for scholarship physics at some point in 2018. I tend to like the ESA study guide for chemistry so currently
have no L2/L3 notes planned.

There are no L1 maths notes planned as the content is so elementary.
