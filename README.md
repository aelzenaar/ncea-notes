# NCEA/Scholarship Notes
These notes pertain to several NZ NCEA/Scholarship standards. I have split them into folders per subject, and the original
LaTeX code is available for most. Any errata/feedback encouraged either via email or the issue tracker.

Hopefully the folder structure is relatively straightforward.

## University Mathematics Book Reviews/Bibliography
See [this page](unibooks.md). Very work-in-progress.

## Mathematics
### Level One
I am not currently tutoring L1, there is not much I have to add in the way of notes as most of the material
is either revision from Y9/10 or simple calculations.
 * Algebra (91027) and Tables, Equations and Graphs (91028): [weekly exercises](L1%20Maths/Algebra/algebra.pdf)
 * Trigonometry (91032): [worksheet](L1%20Maths/Trigonometry/level_1_trig.pdf), [homework](L1%20Maths/Trigonometry/level_1_trig1_hw.pdf).
 * Practice exams: [Algebra](L1%20Maths/Algebra/algebra_paper1.pdf)

### Level Two
My new Level Two Mathematics notes are available [here](L2%20Maths/bookform.pdf). The sheets include:
 1. (2.1) 		Coordinate geometry
 2. (2.4)		Arcs and sectors of circles
 3. (2.4) 		The sine and cosine rules
 4. (2.2) 		Functions and their graphs
 5. (2.2/2.6) 	Linear and quadratic equations
 6. (2.6/2.14) 	Simultaneous equations
 7. (2.6/2.14) 	Linear inequations
 8. (2.6) 		The quadratic formula
 9. (2.2/2.6)	Exponential and logarithmic functions
 10. (2.2/2.6) 	Negative and fractional powers
 11. (2.7) 		Slopes of polynomials and the derivative
 12. (2.7) 		Tangent lines and approximation
 13. (2.7) 		Optimisation
 14. (2.7) 		Functions from slope
 15. (2.7) 		Kinematics
 16. (Stats?)	Counting
 17. (2.3) 		Sequences, series, and fractals
 18. (2.5) 		Graph theory

### Level Three and Scholarship Calculus
 * Generic skills: a [set of notes](L3%20Maths%20Generic/generic.pdf) covering (naive) sets, (rudimentary) proofs, sigma and pi notation, induction,
   the Binomial theorem, and very basic graph theory.
 * Linear programming (91574) and simultaneous equations (91587): a [set of notes](L3%20Linear%20Systems/lineqs.pdf) with some problems.
 * Algebra (91577): a set of notes entitled [_Solutions_](L3%20Algebra/solutions.pdf) designed for self-study for scholarship students
   (with [full answers to exercises](L3%20Algebra/solutions2.pdf)).
 * Differentiation (91578) and integration (91579): a [set of notes](L3%20Calculus/bookform.pdf) containing both tutorial session material
   and homeworks with material ranging in difficulty from achieved to outstanding scholarship.

**In progress:**
 * Geometry notes (similar in style to _Solutions_ for scholarship students, and may be from L1 upwards). In the meantime, I highly recommend
   Lang and Murrow's book _Geometry: A High School Course_ (published by Springer) --- the first edition is available in the University of
   Auckland library at 516 L27 (or online).

I am not intending to write any material on the L3 path analysis standard. Some graph theory is in the general skills notes,
and there is work on weighted graphs in the L2 notes.

## Physics
### Level Two
 * Waves (91170), mechanics (91171), and electromagnetism (91172): [full set of notes](L2%20Physics/externals.pdf), including many diagrams and links to youtube videos,
   but (by design) with limited exercises. To be used with a workbook or similar set of problems.
 * Practice exams: [mechanics](L2%20Physics/Exams/mech.pdf), [electromagnetism](L2%20Physics/Exams/edyn.pdf), and [waves](L2%20Physics/Exams/waves.pdf).

I do not intend to write modern physics notes for L2 at this point in time; my L3 notes revise this material and so can be used for this purpose.

### Level Three
 * Waves (91523), mechanics (91524), modern physics (91525), and electromagnetism (91526): [full set of notes](L3%20Physics/externals.pdf), much terser and much
   longer than level 2, ideal for motivated students for self-study. A large amount of interest material in modern physics is included. Recommend L2 calculus
   with concurrent L3 calculus, but not strictly required. (Very short summary of required mathematics in introductory chapter.)
 * Problem sets related to the above notes can be found [in a subfolder](L3%20Physics/sheets).

## General Science (Level One)
 * [Scientific Investigations and the Scientific Method](L1%20Science/Scientific%20Investigations.odt)
 * Biology (90948): [01 - Genetics and DNA](L1%20Science/Biology/level_1_bio_genes.pdf), [02 - Inheritance and Variation](L1%20Science/Biology/level_1_bio_inheritance.pdf), [03 - Reproduction and Variation](L1%20Science/Biology/level_1_bio_reprod.pdf)
 * Chemistry (90944): [Notes](L1%20Science/Chemistry/notes.pdf)

## Classical Studies
### Scholarship
 * [General exam advice](Scholarship%20Classics/examadvice.pdf).
 * [Basic reading list for a Greek focus](Scholarship%20Classics/reading%20lists.odt).
 * Aristophanes: [practice questions](Scholarship%20Classics/Aristophanes/aristophanes%20questions.odt) and [timeline](Scholarship%20Classics/Aristophanes/aristophanes%20timeline.odt).
 * Alexander the Great: [random notes on sources and early life](Scholarship%20Classics/Alexander%20the%20Great/sources%20and%20early%20life.odt).

**In progress:** Homeworks (and some other notes) for Alexander, general bibliography. Final plan is to have a full reading course written.

## Geography
 * [Key concepts](Geography/Key%20Concepts.odt).
 * Skills practice exams: Mahia: [Questions](Geography/L3-Skills-Mahia-qns.pdf), [Resources](Geography/L3-Skills-Mahia-res.pdf); Chatham Islands: [Questions](Geography/L3-Skills-Chathams-qns.pdf), [Resources](Geography/L3-Skills-Chathams-res.pdf)

## Other in progress
I hope to begin work on specific notes for scholarship physics at some point in 2018. I tend to like the ESA study guide for chemistry so currently
have no L2/L3 notes planned.

There are no L1 maths notes planned as the content is so elementary.
