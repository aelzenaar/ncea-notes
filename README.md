# NCEA/Scholarship Notes
These notes pertain to several NZ NCEA/Scholarship standards. I have split them into folders per subject, and the original
LaTeX code is available for most. Any errata/feedback encouraged either via email or the issue tracker.

Hopefully the folder structure is relatively straightforward.

## Mathematics
### Level Two
The L2 maths material is a bit of a mess.
 * Trigonometry (91259): worksheet (some difficult problems) and assignment.
 * Algebra (91261): worksheet with assorted exam questions.
 * Calculus (91262): full worksheets with questions, homeworks, four practice exams.
 * Probability (91267): worksheet with basic material only.

If I end up tutoring this subject in 2018, I will likely rewrite everything.

### Level Three and Scholarship Calculus
 * Generic skills: a [set of notes](L3%20Maths%20Generic/generic.pdf) covering (naive) sets, (rudimentary) proofs, sigma and pi notation, induction,
   the Binomial theorem, and very basic graph theory.
 * Linear programming (91574) and simultaneous equations (91587): a [set of notes](L3%20Linear%20Systems/lineqs.pdf) with some problems.
 * Algebra (91577): a set of notes entitled [_Solutions_](L3%20Algebra/solutions.pdf) designed for self-study for scholarship students
   (with [full answers to exercises](L3%20Algebra/solutions2.pdf)).
 * Differentiation (91578) and integration (91579): a [set of notes](L3%20Calculus/bookform.pdf) containing both tutorial session material
   and homeworks with material ranging
   in difficulty from achieved to outstanding scholarship.
 * Assorted other scholarship worksheets: some have already been amalgamated into the calculus notes, others have not.

**In progress:**
 * Notes on the two linear algebra standards (systems of equations and linear programming).
 * Geometry notes (similar in style to _Solutions_ for scholarship students, and may be from L1 upwards). In the meantime, I highly recommend
   Lang and Murrow's book _Geometry: A High School Course_ (published by Springer) --- the first edition is available in the University of
   Auckland library at 516 L27 (or online).
 * Replacement scholarship notes and exams. The notes themselves are already part of the more general L3 material, and I have written one
   replacement exam.

I am not intending to write any material on the L3 path analysis standard.

## Physics
### Level Two
 * Waves (91170), mechanics (91171), and electromagnetism (91172): [full set of notes](L2%20Physics/externals.pdf), including many diagrams and links to youtube videos,
   but (by design) with limited exercises. To be used with a workbook or similar set of problems.
 * Practice exams: [mechanics](L2%20Physics/Exams/mech.pdf), [electromagnetism](L2%20Physics/Exams/edyn.pdf), and [waves](L2%20Physics/Exams/waves.pdf).

I do not intend to write modern physics notes for L2 at this point in time; my L3 notes revise this material and so can be used for this purpose.

### Level Three
 * Waves (91523), mechanics (91524), modern physics (91525), and electromagnetism (91526): [full set of notes](L3%20Physics/externals.pdf), much terser and much
   longer than level 2, ideal for motivated students for self-study. A large amount of interest material in modern physics is included.

I have removed the old modern physics sheets as they are now part of the above notes.

## Classical Studies
### Scholarship
 * [General exam advice](Scholarship%20Classics/examadvice.pdf).
 * [Basic reading list for a Greek focus](Scholarship%20Classics/reading%20lists.odt).
 * Aristophanes: [practice questions](Scholarship%20Classics/Aristophanes/aristophanes%20questions.odt) and [timeline](Scholarship%20Classics/Aristophanes/aristophanes%20timeline.odt).
 * Alexander the Great: [random notes on sources and early life](Scholarship%20Classics/Alexander%20the%20Great/sources%20and%20early%20life.odt).

**In progress:** Homeworks (and some other notes) for Alexander, general bibliography. Final plan is to have a full reading course written.

## Geography
 * [Key concepts](Geography/Key%20Concepts.odt).

## Other in progress
I hope to begin work on specific notes for scholarship physics at some point in 2018. I tend to like the ESA study guide for chemistry so currently
have no notes planned (except perhaps for scholarship, but I do not feel that I know the material well enough to write that any time soon). I am taking
a course in spectroscopy next semester so I may write more detailed notes for that topic.

Level 1 maths notes would also be nice but I am not sure that I am the right person to write them!
