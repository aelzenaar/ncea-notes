# NCEA/Scholarship Notes
These notes pertain to several NZ NCEA/Scholarship standards. I have split them into folders per subject, and the original
LaTeX code is available for most. Any errata/feedback encouraged either via email or the issue tracker.

Hopefully the folder structure is relatively straightforward.

## Mathematics
### Level Two
The L2 maths material is a bit of a mess.
 * Trigonometry (91259): worksheet (some difficult problems) and assignment.
 * Algebra (91261): worksheet with assorted exam questions.
 * Calculus (91262): full worksheets with questions, homeworks, four practice exams.
 * Probability (91267): worksheet with basic material only.

### Level Three and Scholarship Calculus
 * Generic skills: a set of notes covering (naive) sets, (rudimentary) proofs, sigma and pi notation, induction, the Binomial theorem, and very basic graph theory.
 * Algebra (91577): a set of notes entitled _Solutions_ designed for self-study for scholarship students (with full solutions).
 * Differentiation (91578) and integration (91579): a set of notes containing both tutorial session material and homeworks with material ranging
   in difficulty from achieved to outstanding scholarship.
 * Assorted other scholarship worksheets: some have already been amalgamated into the calculus notes, others have not.

In progress: geometry notes (similar in style to _Solutions_ for scholarship students) and replacement Scholarship practice exams. I am not intending to write
any material on the L3 path analysis standard.

## Physics
### Level Two
 * Waves (91170), mechanics (91171), and electromagnetism (91172): full set of notes, including many diagrams and links to youtube videos,
   but (by design) with limited exercises. To be used with a workbook or similar set of problems.

I do not intend to write modern physics notes for L2 at this point in time.

### Level Three
 * Modern physics (91525): notes on atomic spectra, the photoelectric effect, and atomic physics.

In progress: set of notes on L3 externals (I have written the section on waves so far), plus notes on relativity and quantum mechanics for the modern physics standard.

## Other in progress
I hope to have a reading course for scholarship classical studies written at some point, as well as specific notes for scholarship physics. I
tend to like the ESA study guide for chemistry so currently have no notes planned (except perhaps for scholarship, but I do not feel that I know
the material well enough to write that any time soon).

Level 1 maths notes would also be nice but I am not sure that I am the right person to write them!
