# Mathematics Book List

This list is an effort to make a list similar and supplementary to the [Chicago undergrad bibliography](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~abhishek/chicmath.htm),
but with a less useful organisational structure based vaguely on the University of Auckland mathematics courses. Library call numbers listed in brackets after
review; (*) denotes a book that the library does not own.

It is less a list of reviews, and more a reminder to me about which books I have enjoyed reading and which books I would like to read more of.

I have just reorganised the list; within each section, the books are roughly ordered by 'difficulty' (whatever that means).

**Note.** The university course numbers listed below are indicative of the content only; I make no claims about difficulty or relevance to
the course as it is usually taught!

**Disclaimers.** The presence of a book on this list does not mean:
 * That you should buy it.
 * That I necessarily stand by the words I have written forevermore after I write them.
 * That I know what I am talking about.

## Culture

 * Paul Halmos, _I Want to be a Mathematician_. As he explains in the preface, this isn't an autobiography. It has a chapter entitled "how to do everything",
   so practical life advice is included. Read this book. (510.973 H19Y)
 * Michael Harris, _Mathematics Without Apologies: Portrait of a Problematic Vocation_. A more modern non-autobiography, I quite enjoyed it. (510 H31)
 * Paul Lockhart, [_A Mathematician's Lament_](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf): A complaint about the U.S. education system
   that is somewhat relevant to NZ. (510.71 L81)
 * Underwood Dudley, _A Budget of Trisections_ and _Mathematical Cranks_. Both very funny, quite quick to read! In _Trisections_, Dudley goes through a selection
   of attempts to [trisect the angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_trisection) using only a straightedge and compass (proved impossible by Wantzel in 1837).
   _Cranks_ is a short collection of random stories. (516.204 D84 and 510 D84)
 * Stephen Krantz, _Mathematical Apocrypha_ and _More Mathematical Apocrypha_. "If it's the quotient rule you wish to know,/It's low-de-high
   less high-de-low./Then draw the line and down below,/Denominator squared will go." (510 K897m and 510 K897ma)
 * Carl E. Linderholm, _Mathematics Made Difficult_. This book needs no introduction and no recommendation, it is a classic. (510 L74)
 * Norman E. Steenrod; Paul R. Halmos; Menahem M Schiffer; and Jean A. Dieudonn√©, _How to Write Mathematics_. This is a collection of four essays,
   the theme being mathematical writing (planning structure, style of writing, etc.). Well worth the read. (510.149 H84)

## Elementary texts: stage I and II

### Single-variable calculus (130, 250)

 * James Stewart, _Calculus_. This is the "recommended" textbook for every UoA calculus course. If you're an engineering student, this book
   is probably fine; it's full of routine problems. If you're a mathematics student, I wouldn't bother buying a copy (there are plenty in the library) - for the
   actual mathematics, see the lecture notes (I haven't taken 150, but the notes for 250 and 253 are high-quality). Note that the content of the courses does not
   necessarily reflect the content of this textbook! (515.15 S84e 2012)
 * Howard Anton, _Calculus_. Isomorphic to Stewart. (515 A63)
 * Silvanus Thompson, _Calculus Made Easy_. This is the book I originally learned calculus from (in year 11, or around 2013-4). It is a little old fashioned,
   but the intuition in here is very clear and the author has a sense of humour! This is perhaps the book I would recommend to the motivated Y12 student or the
   interested Y13 student if they want some reading material. It covers various integration tricks (or 'dodges', as Thompson calls them), as well as some geometry
   (lengths of curves, and curvature) and gives reasonable intuitive justifications for the rules.

   Thompson is unsuitable for even first year university, because it is far from rigorous (it doesn't mention limits, although the recent editions have a
   foreword and initial chapters by Martin Gardner which do cover them to some extent) and is too informal to really be a good introduction to mathematical
   thinking. (515 THO)

 Indeed, my favourite introductory grown-up calculus book is, as you can probably guess, the One True Calculus Book:

 * Michael Spivak, _Calculus_. Do I really need to say any more? Indeed, this book is more of an introductory real analysis book than a 'standard' calculus
   book. I don't believe any university in NZ actually uses it as a course text in first year (or at all), but that is no excuse for students not to use it
   (there always seems to be at least one copy out of the general library despite not being an official text).

   Highlights include a very readable motivation for completeness of the reals and ùúÄ-ùõø proofs; most exercises are also very interesting. I would avoid the
   complex analysis chapters at the end, but beyond that there are no real faults with this book. (The University of Toronto is one university that uses this
   book for their flagship first-year course, which has a reputation for being a trial-by-fire for new mathematics students.) One final bonus: it is cheap (well,
   not really, but cheaper than the shiny calculus books that the book shop sells) and concise (again, it is a doorstop, but much more concise than the texts
   that try to include absolutely everything from biology examples to Stoke's theorem). ([Some comments](http://www.math.toronto.edu/~drorbn/classes/0405/157AnalysisI/SpivakComments/SpivakComments.html)) (515 S76)

### Multi-variable calculus (253, 340)
 * Peter Baxandall & Hans Liebeck, _Vector Calculus_. This book covers the same content as 253 but in much greater detail. It is very geometric, contains
   proofs similar in level and style to those in 253, requires the same level of linear algebra, and covers Gauss' and Stokes' theorems after Green's
   theorem (useful for physics - and in fact it uses electromag and fluid flow as motivational examples throughout). It even ends up stating the real Stokes'
   theorem, the one involving differential forms:- however, it does so in  around twenty pages right at the end, only does it in three dimensions, and
   doesn't really motivate it that well. Oh well, at least it's there...! (It really is a very good book though, apart from that.) (151.84 B35v)
 * Michael Spivak, _Calculus on Manifolds_ or James Munkres, _Analysis on Manifolds_. Vector calculus with rigor, leading to differential forms. Baby
   Spivak doesn't include multi-variable calculus; the "standard" sequel to Spivak in this regard is Daddy Spivak (_Calculus on Manifolds_). However,
   I find this concise introduction a little too concise (and that it introduces technicalities in all the wrong places). Munkres' _Analysis on Manifolds_
   is an expanded and updated book which is (anecdotally) based on Spivak; but I have never liked it that much either. (515.84 S76, 515.84 M96)

My favourite multi-dimensional calculus book, is, in fact, Loomis & Sternberg, _Advanced Calculus_; see below.

### Linear algebra (130, 250, 253)

 * David Poole, _Linear Algebra: A modern introduction_. This is the "recommended" textbook for the linear algebra portion of the 150-250-253 series. It's fine,
   I guess. Lots of routine exercises. Very chatty. Lots of random applications that aren't covered in lectures; nice to take out of the library to flick through.
   Very geometric. Like Stewart, the content of the book is almost orthogonal to the way the course is taught! (512.5 P82)
 * Stewart Venit & Wayne Bishop: _Elementary Linear Algebra_. A shorter book, same content essentially. Includes section on linear programming (missing from Poole;
   this isn't part of any course AFAIK, but is vaguely interesting). Spends a very long time on computations. Not even in the UoA library; don't bother buying a
   copy. (I had a copy given to me.) I actually use this if I need an algorithm/computation notes. (*)
 * Howard Anton: _Elementary Linear Algebra_. Isomorphic to Venit & Bishop. (512.5 A63)
 * Gilbert Strang: _Linear Algebra and its Applications_. I like this book, it is the the book I would recommend someone use
   during a stage I course. Lots of intuition, so you can move on to something more rigorous like Halmos for stage II. He does somewhat fetishise the dimension
   theorem for a linear transformation (he calls it the 'fundamental theorem of linear algebra') but it's not enough to ruin the book. It's probably very
   good for compsci students, there's a lot of algorithm stuff and optimisation and efficiency stuff in here (my edition gives all the computer code in FORTRAN
   and some flavour of BASIC, but it's an old edition). (512.5 S89)
 * Paul Halmos, _Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces_. My favourite linear algebra book! This book covers the same content as 253 but in much greater
   detail. Like every other Paul Halmos book, it is incredibly well-written; just take care not to get bogged down by the sections on multi-linear
   algebra and determinants. The exercises are actually quite similar to those that you should be solving for 253 anyway, just take note of his
   preface (some exercises are introduced before the material that makes them easy). Like _Naive Set Theory_ below, the theorems themselves are
   the real exercises. (515.5 H19f)

### Discrete/computational mathematics (162)

 * Donald Knuth, _Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science_. Apparently this is the one true elementary computational mathematics
   book. I am yet to subject myself to it. (510 G74)

### Logic, "proofs", and naive set theory (255)
 * Kevin Houston, _How to Think Like a Mathematician_. I'm philosophically opposed to a book that tries to teach "proofs" without teaching mathematics, but
   if I had to pick a book to do it it would be this one. It's very slow, very friendly, and incredibly fluffy. I photocopy some parts for college students
   occasionally. (510 H84)
 * Daniel Velleman, _How to Prove It_. Again, I don't like this kind of book in general; this book in particular I can't stand. Some people like it. (511.3 V43)
 * Paul Halmos, _Naive Set Theory_. This is *the* set theory book that you should read. Not many exercises that are marked as such, but the proofs are
   often vague enough that you should be filling bits in on your own anyway. There is an exercises book lying around in the library somewhere if you really
   feel like you need it. (511.322 H19)
 * L.E. Sigler, _Exercises in Set Theory_. In fact, this is that book of exercises. Might be worth a look but as I remember it's a bit dry and not actually
   that good of a companion to Halmos. (511.32 S578)
 * Judith Roitman, _Introduction to Modern Set Theory_. Begins axiomatically, quite a bit harder than Halmos; I would have enjoyed it if I were into logicky
   semanticky stuff. I liked the style. (511.32 R74)

### Elementary number theory (255)
 * Underwood Dudley, _Elementary Number Theory_. This is a cute little introduction to number theory; the first few chapters cover the material needed for 255,
   and the remainder are a mixture of topic chapters (on number representations, prime counting, and so on). As you might expect from this author, the book has
   a definite sense of humour. There is absolutely no algebra used at all, even if it would simplify any argument. This is good from the persepctive
   of 255. (512.7 D84g)
 * Edmund Landau, _Foundations of Analysis_. Construction of the complex numbers and their properties from the Peano axioms. This book is a work of
   art. It makes excellent bathroom reading, despite what the Chicago bibliography would have you believe. (512 L253Y)

### Differential Equations (260)
 * George F. Simmons, _Differential Equations with Applications and Historical Notes_. I have a feeling that most differential equations books tend to be
   a list of one unmotivated trick after another; this is another such book, but it is well-written, includes some fairly nice examples, and some pretty
   geometry. So despite sharing [Rota's opinions](https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/lg5/Rota.pdf) on a superficial level, I have had some good times with
   this book.
 * Vladimir Arnol'd, _Ordinary Differential Equations_. This book is a very nice treatment of the geometry of differential equations, especially those
   forms which one would expect to see in physical situations.

## Upper-level undergraduate texts: Stage III

### Mathematical logic (315)
To add in 2019.

### Algebra (320)
 * M. A. Armstrong, _Groups and Symmetry_. A very geometric book, especially if you liked the algebraic parts of 326. It's similar in philosophy
   to JaÃànich's topology book below, in that it's less rigorous than one would really like for third year. I have actually used some parts for scholarship
   calculus students in the past. (512.2 A73)
 * Nathan Carter, _Visual Group Theory_. This book is worth finding in the library for the pictures, which simply do not exist in most other books. However,
   the actual development of the theory is done much better in other books. (512.2 C325)
 * Joseph Gallian, _Contemporary Abstract Algebra_. This is the book that 320 is based on. Lots of computational exercises. Some "topic" readings at the back
   (Galois theory, crystal point groups, etc), but not enough mathematics is developed to make them worthwhile (his stated goal is something like showing off
   algebra as a modern and up-to-date subject, but he doesn't do enough group and field theory to be able to introduce anything beyond a short historical sketch).
   I can't stand this book: he spends so much time doing computational examples that he hardly gets around to the algebra! Worth buying? No. (Also, it's disgustingly
   expensive.) The library has copies if you feel you need it. (512 G16)
 * Charles Pinter, _A Book of Abstract Algebra_. This is the book that 320 *should* be using, in my opinion. Very readable, lots of interesting
   exercises (both applications, if you're into that kind of thing, and pure mathematics: the proof of the structure theorem for abelian groups
   is left as a structured set of exercises, for example). Also very cheap. Buy this book. (512 P65)
 * Michael Artin, _Algebra_. This is the best introductory algebra book ever written. Lots of geometry (e.g. he classifies all of the motions of the plane).
   Focuses heavily on linear algebra. Maybe a little light on the proofs (not that he's not rigorous, but make sure you do the exercises, or you'll miss out
   on stuff). Highlights include a chapter on Galois theory (first edition only) and a chapter on group representations. (512 A79)
 * John Dixon, _Problems in Group Theory_. Pitched at higher level than 320, but I like it and it should be good for 720 and 721 as well, so well worth the
   cheap price. (512.22 D62)
 * Grigore CaÃÜlugaÃÜreanu and Peter Hamburg, _Exercises in Basic Ring Theory_. Basically what it says on the tin. [512.4 C16]
 * David Bishop, _Group Theory and Chemistry_. Not actually a maths text, it's cute that he tries to prove some of the theorems of elementary group theory but
   I'm not entirely sure why he bothers. If you want applications of the 320 material, look here (but don't look too deep, you might catch chemistry germs). (*)
 * Ian Stewart, _Galois Theory_. Once you have an OK grounding of the material in 320 (basic facts about groups, rings, and fields) then this book is a readable
   introduction to Galois theory. Famously full of typos. Later editions (3rd and 4th) start by proving everything over ***C*** before moving to arbitrary fields.
   Covers all the basic material (field extensions, proof of impossibility of general solutions to the quintic using radicals). Plenty of exercises, computational
   ones as well. (512.32 S84)

### Combinatorics and finite geometry (326)
 * Robin Wilson, _Introduction to Graph Theory_. Elementary book. Easy exercises. Use to study before exam if you're into that kind of thing. (511.6 W75)
 * Rudolf and Gerda Fritsch, _The Four Colour Theorem_. Nice little book for context. (511.5 F919)
 * Robert Wilson, _Graphs, Colourings, and the Four-Colour Theorem_. Proves most of the results for planar graphs and graph colourings that are needed for 326; no
   exercises. (511.5 W74)
 * Miklos Bona, _A Walk Through Combinatorics_. This is the only book you need for 326; it covers everything (bits with more detail than needed, bits with slightly
   not enough). Cute book, but a little pricey. Version in the library is an older edition without design theory. Perhaps a bit chatty and slow to get started, but
   does cover a lot of random topics that should be of interest both for computer science and mathematics. (511.6 B697)
 * Bela Bollobas, _Modern Graph Theory_; Reinhard Diestel, _Graph Theory_. First couple of chapters from these are good for the graph theory part of 326. Nice
   exercises, but take care that these books are harder than you need. (511.6 B69m and 511.5 D56)
 * W.D. Wallis, _Combinatorial Designs_. This book is the must-have book for the block designs section of 326, IMHO. I really like the tone, it goes through a lot
   of different examples and explicit constructions, and it has plenty of literature references. The book is quite good for proofs, and he presents some of the
   arguments in a more explicit way than the lecture notes. The exercises are fine but nothing special (not very many, often computational). The typesetting isn't
   that great. (511.6 W21)
 * Martin Aigner, _Combinatorial Theory_; Jack Graver and Mark Watkins, _Combinatorics with emphasis on the theory of graphs_. These books are far too difficult
   for 326, but I found the more abstract perspectives in the first few chapters rather enlightening; Aigner, for example, develops the theory of counting entirely
   via counting bijections and surjections and so forth; and G&W develops graph theory in a much more abstract way first. (511.6 A28Y) and (511.6 G77)
 * Alvin E. Roth (ed.), _The Shapley value: Essays in honor of Lloyd S. Shapley_. This book includes the original paper by Shapley on assigning power values
   to voting systems, together with a number of essays and papers motivating and extending the paper. (*)

### Number theory
 * Gareth A. Jones and J. Mary Jones, _Elementary Number Theory_. This is a step up from Dudley (see above). There are some very interesting
   problems in here, but the typesetting really annoys me. Don't let the easy nature of the first few chapters fool you. For chapter 5, our lecturer
   gave all the proofs via ring theory; if you know some algebra, write down these proofs yourself (they follow from the fact that a cyclic ring can be
   decomposed into a product of cyclic rings of prime power order; see, for example, Ireland & Rosen) and compare with the ones in here. (512.7 J77)
 * Kenneth Ireland and Michael Rosen, _A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory_. This book develops number theory with algebra at about the
   level of 320. (512.7 I65)

### Single-variable analysis (332)
 * Kenneth R. Davidson and Allan P. Donsig, _Real Analysis and Applications_. For an introduction to real analysis for someone who understands calculus
   at the level of, say, 150 but not 250+ this might be a better choice than Rudin - it's probably comparable to whatever text is recommended for 332, I
   find it incredibly readable, it has a very nice tone, plenty of interesting exercises and examples, and the bits which depend on linear algebra are done
   a lot better than Rudin (but in less generality). I also like the second half (on applications).

   Let me compare it directly with Rudin: Rudin is shorter, denser, and deeper; D&D is longer, friendlier, more detailed, and covers slightly less material.

   One major complaint: there is no explicit construction of the real numbers. (They try to explain a construction via decimal expansions in a very
   handwavy way; there is also almost an outline of a construction via Cauchy sequences in exercise 2.8.L; I know that Tao does this same construction
   in the same kind of detail as the rest of D&D, so it might be an idea to look there for this material. Or in Rudin, or Landau.)

   Like Jones & Jones above, this is another new Springer book with really annoying typesetting, but to a lesser degree. (*)

 * Walter Rudin, _Principles of Mathematical Analysis_. The first eight chapters are an incredibly clean and terse exposition of metric space theory.
   People I know have called it dry, but I didn't actually find it that bad - it is a little lacking in motivation, so maybe it would be a good idea
   to pick up a shiny book like Davidson & Donsig above as well for historical details and more examples.

   I prefer Loomis & Sternberg (see below) for multivariable analysis. (I did try to work through chapter 9, and despite knowing what he was trying to do at every
   point - it's just material from 253 - it's incredibly clunkly and awful. Belive me, I thought the Chicago bibliography would be exaggerating on this
   point, but it turns out that they were entirely correct.)  ([Errata and notes](https://math.berkeley.edu/~gbergman/ug.hndts/#Rudin)) (515.8 R91)
 * A.N. Kolmogorov and S.V. Fomin, _Introductory Real Analysis_. This is not an introductory textbook; it is a high-level geometric (in the Russian
   sense) view of real analysis (in particular, metric space theory). There is plenty of topology, some nice differential equations, and a lot of very
   pretty mathematics. (515.8 K81eYs)

### Topology
 * Klaus JaÃànich, _Topology_. An easy introduction to topology which isn't rigorous enough for a third- or fourth-year course (and probably not appropriate
   for anyone that's actually done any proper analysis, it's very handwavy), but it does have some very nice pictures. I liked it in first year when I
   wanted to learn more about topology. (514.3 J22Y)
 * Jeffrey R. Weeks, _The Shape of Space_. This is supposed to "fill the gap" between the simple geometric examples of topology (Klein bottles, tori) and
   the "sophisticated mathematics of upper-level courses". I don't think it does this job very well, but it is a very nice book of geometry that might even
   be accessible to the layperson. What I would like to see is a book like this that makes explicit the actual links with point-set topology. (514.3 W39)
 * James R. Munkres, _Topology_. This is the standard topology book, it's very clear with lots of examples and pictures. I didn't like the section on
   metric spaces, though - use Rudin here, it's a good supplement. Kolmogorov & Fomin is also nice to read alongside.

   Having thought about it for a while, I think it's incredibly likely that this is the textbook I have spent the most time with over the past year:-
   it was used in the topology course I took in 2018 (MAT 327 at UofT), and I must have spent at least an hour a day with it, doing readings or assignment
   questions. (Perhaps Griffith's _Intro. to Electromagnetism_ is another strong contender; or Halmos' set theory book.)

   ([Errata](http://drorbn.net/index.php?title=10-327/Errata_to_Munkres%27_Book)) (514.3 M96)

### Multi-variable analysis (333)
 * Lynn Loomis and Shlomo Sternberg, _Advanced Calculus_. This book started off as notes for the legendary Math 55 at Harvard (a first year course!);
   it starts off with a recap of linear algebra (really one of the best `second courses in linear algebra' I've looked at), and ends up around 500
   pages later with a very nice approach to differential forms. This is my favourite calculus text of all time, but it is probably a little too much
   for students in first year! (Or even students who have completed 253 to be honest... perhaps 255 is enough preparation? The preface recommends baby
   Spivak as prep, so maybe 332 is the best prerequisite course.) Highlights include a rigorous (and clear) treatment of infinitesimal functions and
   differentials, and a final chapter on applications to theoretical physics. The exposition tries to explain a great
   deal of the 'philosophy of doing mathematics', which I quite like - see, for example, the chapter on uniformity and compactness. (515.8 L86)


### Algebraic geometry (334)
To add in 2019.

### Complex calculus and analysis (340, 341)
The first few books here, broadly speaking, are complex calculus books; the latter books are complex analysis books.
 * Stephen D. Fisher, _Complex Variables_. The main problem with this book is that it's trying to be both a rigorous book and a
   calculus book and failing miserably at both. I don't hate the sections on the geometry of analytic functions (chapter 3), but
   chapters 1 and 2 attempt to build the basic theory of analytic and holomorphic functions without using phrases like 'uniformly convergent'.
   The main mechanism used for this is Green's Theorem (for double integrals), and I found it unsatisfying and insufficient. Further,
   a non-negligible number of the problems seem to be pitched at a higher level of rigour than the proofs in the text (either that, or
   one must hand-wave away enough topology that they become trivial). There are a minimum of examples. (515.93 F53)
 * E.B. Saff and A.D. Snider, _Fundamentals of Complex Analysis for Mathematics, Sci...etc._ Basically a calculus book, so if you like Stewart
   or Anton you'll probably like this. I don't hate it, and I found it useful for complex calculus, if a little dry. The problems are much better
   than Fisher (in that they fit the style of the book). More examples than Fisher. It's a bit expensive, because it's a calculus book... (515.9 S12)
 * Tristan Needham, _Visual Complex Analysis_. This book attempts to construct complex analysis purely geometrically. It is quite successful
   in building intuition, but there are no proofs at all and a number of theorems are only (strongly) hinted at rather than stated - even important ones
   like Cauchy's theorem. (515.9 N37)
 * John Conway, _Functions of One Complex Variable I_. He uses 'analytic' to mean 'holomorphic'. Beyond this, I found the book to be readable,
 * Walter Rudin, _Real and Complex Analysis_. From chapter 10, the best book on complex analysis I have found. It is possible to read
   the complex analysis half, broadly speaking, without having read the real analysis half; one just needs to replace all the integration
   theorems with less general theorems involving the Riemann integral. (515.7 R916)
   if a little slow. (515.93 C76)

### Classical geometry
 * Serge Lang and Gene Murrow, _Geometry: A High School Course_. Wait, a Lang book for high school students?! (Please allow me to repeat the standard
   joke: the reason Bourbaki stopped writing new textbooks is that he realised Lang was just one person.) In all seriousness, all high school geometry
   texts that I know of are terrible, but this is the least so. (516 L27)

 * Robin Hartshorne, _Geometry: Euclid and Beyond_.  Hartshorne follows Euclid, putting him on a firm axiomatic foundation. The capstone of the book is a discussion
   of polyhedra. You should have a little algebra for the last stretch, but the rest should actually be accessible to a high-school student! (516 H33)
 * John M. Lee, _Axiomatic Geometry_. This book is like Hartshorne but in a much more formal style; it's written for future teachers, but it develops Euclidean
   geometry (and only Euclidean geometry, although there is some hyperbolic stuff at the end) in a synthetic and formal way. I secretly quite like this book,
   but I will never admit it. This is the book I use to look things up if I feel the urge to know how (for example) the inscribed angle theorem is proved. (516 L47)

 * Kieth Kendig, _Conics_. This book is everything you always suspected about conic sections and it is amazing. Please read it. (516.352 K33)
 * George Salmon, _A Treatise on Conic Sections_. If you read Kendig and want to know more, this book (from the 1800s) is very good but a little difficult to read
   due to its age. Serving recommendation: read and try to make Salmon's statements precise with projective geometry and/or complex algebra. (516.3 S17)

 * Alfred S. Posamentier and Charles S. Salkind, _Challenging Problems in Geometry_. Heard of Ceva's theorem and want to know more? Want to learn some
   geometry? Buy this (cheap) book and do all the problems. All are very good. Difficulty from school level upwards. (*)
 * Marta Sved, _Journey into Geometries_. This is a very strange book which motivates non-Euclidean geometry (hyperbolic geometry in particular) with
   the characters of Alice in Wonderland. It's well worth the read. (516.0076 S96)
 * Harold Coxeter, _Introduction to Geometry_ and _Geometry Revisited_. These books are both full of a lot of nice university geometry with some quite
   nice links to other subjects: for example, crystallography and biology. _Revisited_ doesn't require any more than basic school geometry, but _Introduction_
   is quite sophisticated and difficult to read cover-to-cover as he uses a wide variety of techniques from different fields (group theory, linear algebra,
   calculus) without any warning. It is very easy to expand a lot of what Coxeter says in half a page into hours of
   fruitful ~~messing about with a blackboard~~ thinking. (I have used part of _Intro._ as a basis for a set of NCEA level 3 geometry notes,
   and managed to expand three pages of Coxeter into around thirty pages of notes.) (516 C87, 516 C87g)
 * Marcel Berger, _Geometry_. But this is my favourite geometry book.  It is a little long (two volumes), but you can dip in and out of it rather than
   reading linearly. There are many nice pictures, including of physical models; in addition, almost every geometric theorem I've ever seen in any paper
   is included here (although often under a different name). There are a lot of very pretty results in both affine and projective geometry. Linear algebra
   and group theory are used extensively (of course). (516 B49)

### Differential geometry
 * Manfred do Carmo, _Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces_. Differential geometry, without any more machinery than multivariable
   calculus. Quite dry and very computational. This is actually useful for physics (in particular, PHYSICS 201). (516.36 C28Y)
 * Michael Spivak, _A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry_. Five volumes of painfully typeset beautiful geometry. 10/10 would etc. etc. (516.36 S76)

## Books I want to get around to reading and/or writing about here
 * Coxeter, _Regular Polytopes_.
 * O'Rourke, _Geometric folding algorithms_.
 * Something on knot theory? (Cromwell, _Knots and Links_ ?)

## My favourite books
 * Artin, _Algebra_
 * Berger, _Geometry_
 * Halmos, _Naive Set Theory_
 * Hartshorne, _Geometry: Euclid and Beyond_
 * Landau, _Foundations of Analysis_
 * Loomis and Sternberg, _Advanced Calculus_
 * Rudin, _Principles of Mathematical Analysis_
 * Wallis, _Combinatorial Designs_
