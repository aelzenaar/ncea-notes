# Mathematics Book List

This list is an effort to make a list similar to the [Chicago undergrad bibliography](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~abhishek/chicmath.htm), but tailored
more towards the UoA curriculum.

## Culture

 * Paul Halmos, _I Want to be a Mathematician_: As he explains in the preface, this isn't an autobiography. It has a chapter entitled "how to do everything",
   so practical life advice is included.
 * Paul Lockhart, [_A Mathematician's Lament_](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf): A complaint about the U.S. education system
   that is somewhat relevant to NZ.
 * Underwood Dudley, _A Budget of Trisections_ and _Mathematical Cranks_: Both very funny, quite quick to read! In _Trisections_, Dudley goes through a selection
   of attempts to [trisect the angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_trisection) using only a straightedge and compass (proved impossible by Wantzel in 1837).
   _Cranks_ is a short collection of random stories.

## Stage I: MATHS 150/253

I don't really have opinions on stage I texts, they're all pretty rubbish!

### Calculus

 * James Stewart, _Calculus_. This is the "recommended" textbook for the calculus portion of 150 (and 250, and 253). If you're an engineering student, this book
   is probably fine; it's full of routine problems. If you're a mathematics student, I wouldn't bother buying a copy (there are plenty in the library) - for the
   actual mathematics, see the lecture notes (I haven't taken 150, but the notes for 250 and 253 are high-quality). Note that the content of the courses does not
   necessarily reflect the content of this textbook!
 * Howard Anton, _Calculus_. Isomorphic to Stewart.
 * Michael Spivak, _Calculus_. This is the best calculus text for mathematicians. Much more rigorous than Stewart, and plenty of interesting problems. Have on the
   side while reading through the lecture notes. (Should be good for the analysis that's at the end of 255 as well.)

### Linear Algebra

 * David Poole, _Linear Algebra_: A modern introduction. This is the "recommended" textbook for the linear algebra portion of the 150-250-253 series. It's fine,
   I guess. Lots of routine exercises. Very chatty. Lots of random applications that aren't covered in lectures; nice to take out of the library to flick through.
   Very geometric. Like Stewart, the content of the book is almost orthogonal to the way the course is taught!
 * Stewart Venit & Wayne Bishop: _Elementary Linear Algebra_. A shorter book, same content essentially. Includes section on linear programming (missing from Poole;
   this isn't part of any course AFAIK, but is vaguely interesting). Spends a very long time on computations. Not even in the UoA library; don't bother buying a
   copy. (I had a copy given to me.)
 * Howard Anton: _Elementary Linear Algebra_. Isomorphic to Venit & Bishop.

## Stage II

### Calculus (253)
 * Peter Baxandall & Hans Liebeck, _Vector Calculus_: This book covers the same content as 253 but in much greater detail. Most of the exercises are
   computational; proofs mainly computational. Some nice examples. Nicer than Stewart, anyway. (You do need linear algebra for this book.)

### Linear Algebra (253/255)
 * Paul Halmos, _Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces_: This book covers the same content as 253 but in much greater detail. Like every other Paul Halmos book, it
   is incredibly well-written; just take care not to get bogged down by the sections on multi-linear algebra and determinants. The exercises are actually quite
   similar to those that you should be solving for 253 anyway, just take note of his preface (some exercises are introduced before the material that makes them
   easy).
 * Sheldon Axler, _Linear Algebra Done Right_: On my list to read. Supposed to be very good.
 * Werner Greub, _Linear Algebra_: (Massive) step up from Halmos and Axler; I haven't read it cover to cover, but what I've read is great.

### "Proofs" (255)
 * Kevin Houston, _How to Think Like a Mathematician_: I'm philosophically opposed to a book that tries to teach "proofs" without teaching mathematics, but
   if I had to pick a book to do it it would be this one. It's very slow, very friendly, and incredibly fluffy. I photocopy some parts for college students
   occasionally.
 * Daniel Velleman, _How to Prove It_: Again, I don't like this kind of book in general; this book in particular I can't stand. Some people like it.

### Number Theory (255)
 * Underwood Dudley, _Elementary Number Theory_: This is a very cute book, covers a bit more than is needed for 255 but I would recommend going through it. Cheap,
   so worth buying for just that alone. I wouldn't say that this is the best introductory number theory book, as it just skips through the highlights. Lots of
   easy exercises, some difficult ones. For 255, get this one; if you like it, find something more substantial.
 * Edmund Landau, _Foundations of Analysis_: The Chicago bibliography says that this book makes for terrible bathroom reading; I would honestly keep a copy
   of this in the bathroom just because it's so beautiful. Landau develops the theory of complex arithmetic from the Peano axioms, and it's something every
   mathematician should read at some point in their lives.
 * Kenneth Ireland and Michael Rosen: _A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory_: Read after doing 320. Very good book.

### Set Theory (255)
 * Paul Halmos, _Naive Set Theory_: This is *the* first set theory book that you should read. Not many exercises that are marked as such, but the proofs are
   often vague enough that you should be filling bits in on your own anyway. There is an exercises book lying around in the library somewhere if you really
   feel like you need it.
 * Judith Roitman, _Introduction to Modern Set Theory_: Begins axiomatically, quite a bit harder than Halmos; I would have enjoyed it if I were into logicky
   semanticky stuff.

## Stage III

### Algebra (320+)
 * Joseph Gallian, _Contemporary Abstract Algebra_: This is the book the course is based on. Jianbei's notes are generally a condensed version of Gallian,
   but he does prove some things differently. Lots of computational exercises. Some "topic" readings at the back (Galois theory, crystal point groups, etc).
   I can't stand this book: he spends so much time doing computational examples that he hardly gets around to the algebra! Very slow to start (like the
   course itself). Worth buying? No. (Also, it's overly expensive.) The library has copies if you feel you need it.
 * Charles Pinter, _A Book of Abstract Algebra_: This is the book that 320 *should* be using. Very readable, lots of interesting exercises (both applications,
   if you're into that kind of thing, and pure mathematics: the proof of the structure theorem for abelian groups is left as a structured set of exercises, for
   example). Also very cheap. Buy this book.
 * Michael Artin, _Algebra_: This is the best introductory algebra book ever written. Lots of geometry (e.g. he classifies all of the motions of the plane).
   Focuses heavily on linear algebra. Maybe a little light on the proofs (not that he's not rigorous, but make sure you do the exercises, or you'll miss out
   on stuff). Highlights include a chapter on Galois theory (first edition only) and a chapter on group representations.
 * John Dixon, _Problems in Group Theory_: A bit difficult, but (and?) I like it. Should be good for 720 and 721 as well, so well worth the 15ish dollars it
   costs.
 * David Bishop, _Group Theory and Chemistry_: Not actually a maths text, it's cute that he tries to prove some of the theorems of elementary group theory but
   I'm not entirely sure why he bothers. If you want applications of the 320 material, look here (but don't look too deep, you might catch chemistry germs).
 * Ian Stewart, _Galois Theory_: Once you have an OK grounding of the material in 320 (basic facts about groups, rings, and fields) then this book is a readable
   introduction to Galois theory. Famously full of typos. Later editions (3rd and 4th) start by proving everything over *C* before moving to arbitrary fields.
   Covers all the basic material (field extensions, proof of impossibility of general solutions to the quintic using radicals). Plenty of exercises, computational
   ones as well. [Stewart is a semi-famous pop-maths author too, if you have family who are into that kind of book. Well worth looking into anything he's written,
   although over the past few years he seems to have rewritten the same book multiple times under different titles!]
 * Harold Edwards, _Galois Theory_: A GTM that is my preferred text on Galois theory. Not really good for a first intro after 320 --- read Stewart or Artin first.
   Goes via a more classico-historical route, using proofs that Galois would have understood.

### Combinatorics (326)
 * Miklos Bona, _A Walk Through Combinatorics_: This is the only book you need for 326; it covers everything (bits with more detail than needed, bits with slightly
   not enough). Cute book, but a little pricey. Version in the library is an older edition without design theory.
 * Robin Wilson, _Introduction to Graph Theory_: Elementary book. Easy exercises.
 * Rudolf and Gerda Fritsch, _The Four Colour Theorem_: Nice little book for context.
 * Robert Wilson, _Graphs, Colourings, and the Four-Colour Theorem_: Proves most of the results for planar graphs and graph colourings that are needed for 326; no
   exercises.
 * Bela Bollobas, _Modern Graph Theory_; Reinhard Diestel, _Graph Theory_: First couple of chapters from these are good for the graph theory part of 326. Nice
   exercises, but take care that these books are harder than you need.
 * P.J. Cameron and J.H van Lint: _Graphs, Codes and Designs_: I really like this book. It's a bit terse and denser than you need, but I like it.
 * W.D. Wallis, _Combinatorial Designs_: Still reading this, quite liking it.
 * Zhe-Xian Wan, _Design Theory_: Same for this one.
 * Robin Hartshorne, _Geometry: Euclid and Beyond_: I'm almost cheating putting this book here. It covers the finite geometry part of 326, but the real reason
   you should read it is because it is amazing. Hartshorne follows Euclid, putting him on a firm axiomatic foundation. The capstone of the book is a discussion
   of polyhedra. You should have a little algebra for the last stretch, but the rest should actually be accessible to a high-school student!
